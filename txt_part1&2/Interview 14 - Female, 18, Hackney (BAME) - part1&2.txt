I'm going to put it here, so I can hear you well, is that okay, if I leave it here? Yeah, that's fine. Um... so can we talk about what you've put in the first box, please? In the first box, I've put a stick man by himself and like a group of three people, so is there to show like them talking, like maybe relating to each other, conversating and like you have a person by, by themselves, singled out, like kind of conveying the idea of alienation, like feeling unable to fit in socially and in my second image... *gets interrupted* No, before we go into the second one, I just wanted to go through the first one with you a bit more, so you're saying that... no, no, that's alright, I can see from here, thank you. Okay. Hm, so what did you write here? I said the idea of alien-, alienation, not being able to fit in socially. Okay, tell me about... um, let's actually go one by one, so tell me about alienation. Like, I feel like when you're singled out, in a sense, you t-, you kind of like get like, you take on the view that maybe people don't like you and in such may lead to like negative emotions and stuff like that and I feel, especially within, um, like teenagers, not being able to fit in socially is quite a big thing, so I feel like that is what can be associated with the experience of loneliness. So not being, not fitting in... Yeah. ... it's associated with loneliness? Yeah, in a sense yeah. Can you tell me more about that? I'm trying to think about how to word it; I feel like when you're young, I feel like people feel like there's a type of way you should act or behave and for people to feel like they're not fitting in, they would maybe in a sense like alter their way, they alter their way of like themselves to try to fit in with others or try like how, like a sense of belongingness and I feel like it's not really true to yourself and when you're not true to yourself, deep down, you feel like you don't belong and that would lead to like a lot of loneliness, yeah. So, you're saying that um, not being true to yourself and doing the things that you may not necessarily like but doing it for the sake of fitting in... Exactly ... make you feel lonely on the inside. Yeah. Can you tell me more about that? I'm trying, I feel like maybe an easy way I could put this in terms, like for example, someone who may hide their sexuality from like peers, so they themselves know that deep down they like who they like, but they express it different, and I feel like that could eat a person away inside and like not being able to relate with anyone else, because they think you're a certain type of person may, yeah, just may make you feel lonely. So not being able to express your true sense of self makes you feel lonely. How does that, how would that make, make, how would that make you feel? Lonely *chuckles* mmh, I'll try to elaborate... maybe not being, I feel like not being true to yourself is one of the main things that may break you down and I feel like if you're not able to live, I just don't feel like people aren't able to function adequately, if they're not, just not being true to themselves, I feel like there's like something deep down that will always kind of irritate them in a way and may lead to other stuff, if that makes sense. So not being able to express yourself, you know, makes you feel inadequate in a way. Yeah. Okay, and what did you put here? Is it? Does it say gossip? A group. Oh group, okay. Um... so basically you're saying that when you are alienated, um, um, or when you, for example, aren't able to fully express yourself because you want to fit in, actually makes you feel lonely. Yeah. Can you tell me some of the feelings that, you know, you might experience if you were that individual? Hmm Or someone who might *gets interrupted* I feel like that may lead to depression, maybe, because I feel like your thoughts has a lot to do with how, your thoughts affect your mental health, like your mental state a lot and I feel like if deep down you know what you like and what you want and then you're expressing someone externally completely different, I feel like that can lead to a lot of depression and yeah, just really affect your mental state. *pause* Okay... um, is there anything else you want to say about that? Hmm, it may alter your like your perception on life and yourself, because maybe the experience of loneliness, yeah the experience of loneliness may feel like you're not average, you're not normal and I feel like that type of outlook on life can bring a person down and that could lead to lot of negative thoughts and emotion, which can then like, like lead to maybe um, disorders such as depression, stuff like that, and that could then lead to like suicidal thoughts, which isn't very good, but I've noticed, I've put down a lot of negative things, I feel like... I think it's best if you focus on this one first, are you kind of focusing on this or are you... I was doing it as a whole. Um okay, you know, I think if it's, if you don't mind, maybe we can work on this one and then move on to this one, and then to this one, is that okay? Yeah, they're all kind of interlinked. Yeah, yeah, for sure, definitely, so feel free to interject, if you like, you know, you want to bring them from other ones, but I didn't want to interrupt your thoughts, um, can you, do you want to carry on? On the second image or stay on the first? No, I was just going to ask you, because you mentioned the feeling of, you know, feeling that you're not average or you're not normal can lead to the feeling lonely? Yeah. Can you tell me more about that? That was from this one. Um... okay, okay, so is there anything else you want to say about this one? Yeah, I feel like amongst, I feel like social groups and like the feeling that... I feel like people may alter themselves, in order to fit into a certain type of social group and therefore they're not being a true self, which leads to a lot of loneliness and yeah, which can lead to other negative things. How does that make you feel? I feel like altering yourself in order to make someone happy or to fit in isn't what life should be about, I feel like people should be accepted for themselves and when is, I just don't, I just feel like, yeah, I just feel like everyone should be free to do what they want to do and be who they want to be, without feeling that burden by anybody else's opinions and yeah. So being able to, so for example, being able to not care about what other people think of you... Yeah ... can help. I feel like it's easier said than done, in a sense that you can always say that 'oh, someone says something about you and you don't really care', but deep down that may be continuously going on in your mind, in your mind and although you may think is not affecting you, it might be chipping away slowly and such may be altering you as a person and then you just start to feel like, because you're changing yourself, this isn't who you are and it's just that sense of loneliness that intervenes again. Can you mention the last part again? Sorry, I'm trying to remember. Pardon? Can you mention just the last part, if you don't mind? I can't even remember what I have just said *says laughing* Something may um, I was just thinking about something, okay, so you're saying that, basically, um, life should be about being true to yourself. Yeah... And, and you might basically say that 'oh, I don't care about what other people think of me', but there is some parts... That still internalizes within a person, I feel like as much as we may want to argue and be like 'oh, I don't care', it's still, it's still within ourself, if that makes sense, like it's still there and, I feel like the more and more you hear it, the more, more, a person may start to believe it and such may alter a person's well-being, which then again, they're not being their true selves may lead to the idea of loneliness, yeah. When you said the more and more they hear about it, can you tell me more about that? So, for example, someone's telling you something about yourself, you may want to argue the point that that's not me, that's not true, which then if you hear it again, and again, a person may want to like believe that in a sense, which leads to the idea of loneliness. Okay... and how does that make you feel? Again, I just don't think someone should alter the way they are to please someone else. Hmm. Yeah. Thank you, is there anything else you want to say about that? No. Okay, can we talk about what you've put next? Um... I said 'feeling like you're unable to talk or relate to anyone', I feel like if a person is unable to talk to someone or even if they do talk to someone, the person isn't able to fully un-, understand what they're saying, then they just feel like 'what's the point?', like no one else understands and I feel like keeping everything in is not a good way of coping with it, so then that leads to the idea of loneliness, because it's just you and your thoughts and I feel like your thoughts can play a big thing on your mental state, which then can lead to that negative outlets, yeah. So, you're saying that not, so others not understanding you, can, can lead to loneliness? Yeah. Tell me more about that. So for example, if you're trying to talk to someone, if you do find someone to talk to and try to relate with and like everything you say they're shutting you down, you just feel like 'what's the point?', if I've tried to confide in one person once, you don't, you're really hesitant to do it again and from there now, you just keep yourself to yourself, really, and then that leads to loneliness. And how does that make you feel? Again, I just don't think people should, if someone's coming to you expressing the way they feel, I feel like everyone should come to a situation of open mind and try to understand that person from their shoes and like maybe you may, you may have your belief and they may have their beliefs, but try to put yourself in their position and see where they're coming from, just to make the person feel better in a sense and just like comfort them. And um... let's say, for example, if people don't understand you, let's say you're going through a difficult time and, and you feel like whatever you say doesn't matter because others don't understand you, how would that make you feel? Could you repeat that again, please? I'm just wondering, you know, because you've put down like people not understanding you, so I wondered, let's say like you're trying to make yeah, people don't understand what you're going through and you're trying to get them to understand, but they're not understanding it, how would that make you feel? I feel like it would cause a built-up frustration because trying to get your point across over and over again is quite annoying and then feeling that you need to explain yourself and you might like may believe strongly in something is annoying, I don't feel like anybody should be able to explain themselves consistently, just so people could understand them, so that may lead to a person becoming very reserved and just not wanting to express themselves and like from not being able to express yourself, you may just, again stay to yourself and then that in itself just makes you feel lonely, because it's like 'what's the point?', if no one wants to hear what you're saying or wants to try to understand what they're trying to say *pause* yeah. And um, what did you put here? Nobody understands me *reads* Yeah, because I feel like as a person if they're trying to get their point across, it's them trying to express themselves and that in itself 'nobody understands' me because it's them trying to talk, talk about themselves and nobody wants to listen, if that makes sense? That's why I use that specific pronoun. And if nobody is trying to listen, how, how would that make that person feel? Again, maybe quite distressed and annoyed, I feel like there's a lot of emotions that person feels, maybe angry, frustrated, maybe is just sad, for like, different people express their emotions differently, so there is some person mi-, someone might um, come to the situation like being rejected, when they're trying to relate, they might just start crying, another person might just start shouting, for like it just depends on the person. Hmm, and can you read this again? So... Feeling that you are unable to talk slash relate to anyone. Mmh *movements' noise* Thanks. Um... feeling like you are not able to relate to someone, can you tell me a little more about that? I feel like if a person is lonely and they have someone else they are able to relate with then it takes off a bit of distress, because they know that 'Oh, someone else out there is feeling exactly the way I'm feeling' and I feel that, in himself, having someone to talk to, can reduce your stress and can make you feel like maybe, in a sense, that the whole world is not against you and you've got, and someone else is out there just like me and I feel like it eases the idea of loneliness, because someone else can relate to what you're be-, you're um, what you are thinking or you believe in and that in itself just allows others to notice and reduces the idea of loneliness. So, having someone that might be similar to you... Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. 'Cause then again, you don't feel exactly like the minority anymore, you feel more, maybe in a sense, for example, someone's trying to have, someone had their opinion and they want to state their opinion, but it was just them, maybe if someone else came in that was able to relate to their opinion, they will feel more compelled to try like state exactly what they're trying to say, because there's someone else by them side which also agrees with what they're saying, so it's easier for them to push forth their argument. So having someone who can understand, who can relate... Yeah. ... and... Kind of takes the strain of it, makes it a bit more easier. How would that make you feel? Hmm, I feel like if a person has someone they are able to relate to, it makes the situation, like it has a whole new outlook on a situation, because it just makes it a bit more lighter because you know, you're not carrying it a hundred percent by yourself and you're able to express your feelings to someone else, which in turn just reduces the idea of loneliness because you know that you're not really lonely anymore, because there's someone else out there that also may express the same views or may understand where you're coming from. Thanks, do you want to say more about that? Um... not really. Okay, thanks. Can we talk about what you've put next? Um, I said negative emotions slash perspective on self or life and that may lead to displaying signs of depression slash anxiety slash like constantly crying, so I feel like when a person may feel lonely, when they're in their like natural habitat, so maybe like their rooms, like when they're singled out, maybe by themselves, you may see more of their emotions, which is often negative, so for example, they might start crying uncontrollably and who knows maybe start self-harming, because they just aren't understood by other people and such may lead to like a negative perspective on life itself or them as a person and such can lead to like negative things happening, so... like suicidal thoughts and stuff like that, yeah. So not, I'm just going back to what you said, um people not, you know, understanding what that individual or whatever is going through might lead them to feeling, you know, depressed. Yeah and I feel like because then again the idea of loneliness comes into it, people and like people not understanding that person, their depression otherwise goes unnoticed, so it's unable to be treated and therefore it may like lead to other stages and other things happening, or the depression just gets worse and because they're kind of like s-, they might start like self-medicating themselves, so again, maybe start self-harming or maybe having suicidal thoughts, which just isn't good at all. So negative, you wrote here 'negative emotions'. Yeah. Tell me more about negative emotions. Um, I said stuff like crying, being like unable to find the good in situations, I feel like if you're lonely, I feel like every situation makes you feel lonely and it's constantly, like it's constantly in your, I'm trying to figure out how to word this, if a situation constantly keeps going on repeat in your mind and it's a negative situation, I feel like that takes over everything you do, so everything, yeah, it takes over everything you do and then your perspective on everything just becomes negative, and then that leads to you just becoming maybe like a negative person, thinking the worst and everything covered in like bad thoughts and that type of way of thinking will lead to like negative emotions, maybe you just feeling like 'what's the point?' sometimes, crying all the times, maybe being unable to socialize with others, staying in your bed, just feeling like 'what's the point?', then again, just the whole idea of depression, just feeling, just like completely in your feelings, yeah. It sounds like, what you're saying is um, you know, having negative thoughts, for example, can make you think, like making you think, making you have a negative outlook on life, seeing the worse in situations, um and then just thinking 'what's the point?' Yeah, definitely, I feel like once the person becomes, is it, it's not optimist, the... ... opposite? Opposite of that, I feel like once a person becomes that, they just feel like everything in life is negative and then they take on that stance and I feel like, if you were able to, like maybe if you, when you're around others, that may start like inflicting on them and I just feel like the whole negativity can ruin a person's energy and yeah, it spreads, kind of the negative energy spreads. And how would that make you feel? I feel like if a person is unable to express themselves to the point where it affects the outlook on themselves and the outlook on life, it's quite... irritating, because I feel like a lot of the time it can lead to like mental health problems and I feel like it's not, it won't be treated, because people aren't paying attention to the person, because obviously then they again have that, they're experiencing the idea of loneliness and the, from it not being treated or anything like that, can lead to worser things, such as, like depression, anxiety and yeah, their mental health just worsens. *pause* and what did you put here? Um displaying signs of depression, anxiety and then I said, for example, like constantly crying *silence*, yeah, I feel like, linking back to this one, when you're unable to relate to anyone or talk to someone, you build up everything that you're trying to say and maybe express that to yourself and I feel like one way of expressing that may be through your emotions, so like crying and stuff like that and maybe it may have felt like something positive to like let out your emotions, but I feel like if it's something that's becoming consistently, consistent over a period of time, it's starts becoming negative and is not, it can't be seen as a good way of expressing yourself, but then again that goes unnoticed, because you may have tried to talk to someone or relate to someone, that person hasn't really taken you in or tried to understand you and then they just leave you alone and then that just worsens your emotions really, yeah. So, sometimes like, what you're saying is sometimes like people, if people don't understand you, it kind of makes it feel worse. Yeah, 'cause, then again the whole idea of alienation, where you just feel like you're unable to fit in and maybe because I feel like if you're going through something, you would always confide in someone you trust the most, maybe someone that's professional, in a sense, that they can give advice in that particular area, but if they're unable to understand where you're coming from, you just feel like maybe you're the problem and such may lead to negative thoughts and emotions or negative actions and maybe like the whole perspective of themself, I don't, yeah. So, so if you feel that the person you really trust can't give you an advice, or can't help you, then you start thinking that maybe there's a problem with you or... I don't think necessarily that they can't, because a lot of the times if a person comes to you and you, I feel like a person can be unable to help someone that they care about, but I feel like if the person kind of shuts them down or just doesn't listen to what they're saying or maybe just laughs, laughs it away, then that's when it may become a problem, 'cause if someone is trying to like understand where you're coming from, but they're unable to give help or unable to maybe try like medicate the situation, then you know that the person does care, but they don't know how to deal with it and I feel like that's where the person may try and like push forth the idea of maybe professional help with someone who has knowledge in that particular area, who can help the person, but I feel like if it was someone else that, um where they went to someone, who they maybe trusted and the person just shut them down, just tell them not to worry about, maybe not worry about it, but just told them that they're being silly or maybe overdramatic, then that person may feel like they're able to relate to that person and then that may lead to the negative emotions. You said like, people like shutting that individual or just telling them 'oh, like you're thinking silly', and just kind of putting them off, how would that make you feel? I feel like, personally, if I was trying to confide in someone and, someone especially who I trusted, and that person is telling me I was being silly or maybe overdramatic, I would be quite frustrated just to know that I had trust in a person and for them to maybe shut down my ideas or my opinion on this particular thing, I just don't think that's the correct way a friend should help deal with the situation, I just feel like, at that point in time, you may feel lonely, because maybe someone who you thought was similar to you, or just like you, just kind of ___ (28:09) the situation, just made it into a game almost, you just feel kind of belittled, in a sense, and like kind of reduces your self-worth. And feeling belittled, um, can lead to loneliness. Yeah, exactly, I feel like if you're made to feel less than what you actually are, your self-worth decreases, because, especially by someone that you trust or maybe went like, you've confided in, if they just shut you down then, they're just belittling you and you just feel lonely because the person who you trusted has just let you down. Hmm, feeling, like when you're let down, can make you feel lonely. Yeah, especially by someone, I feel like being let down by someone you don't know it may annoy you, but it won't affect you as much as being let down by someone who you have like a relationship with, 'cause then is like 'oh that person may not care about me, or that person may not value me as a person', and such may lead to the idea of loneliness, because you may have thought that this person was, was, um, maybe one of your closest and then now it's just like they don't care anymore, yeah, especially like in your time of need, if they're just not showing any interest that in itself just makes you feel lonely. So, the people that you care about or that you feel, feel like you trust them, if they don't show any interest... Yeah, I feel like *pause*, in a sense, I feel like, um, them not, I feel like you need to differentiate between them not feeling any interest or them not understanding, because I feel like a person may want to help, but they don't know how, they don't really understand the situation, therefore, they are unable to help, but I feel like a person who understands the situation, but just shuts it down, and tries like minimizing it, that just shows that they're not trying to help and then they're just belittling the situation, but then again a person who's, who wants to help, but knows they can't help, doesn't really do anything for the person, so then it's like they're still lonely, but the friend was still there for them, in a sense, if that makes sense, yeah. Thank you, is there anything else you want to say about that box? No. Okay, can we talk about what you've put in the final box, please? This one I kind of touched on previously, because I didn't really know what to put in it, but I've put depression and I said such behavior can lead to suicidal thoughts, which I've touched on previously. I just feel like, um, when a person may feel loneliness, especially after like confides in a person, they may like, I feel like they may experience negative thoughts and such may affect their mental state and then again lead into the idea of depression, or other um, disorders that may impact them and their behavior and that might lead to like suicidal thoughts and I feel like sometimes like suicidal cases, people feel like they need to end their lives in order to let their voice be heard, so like, but it's like a too late type of thing, so I feel like, maybe once a person in need like kill themselves, it's like a way for them to cry out for help, but that's a way for them to express themselves, if that makes sense, I don't know if, I'm trying to articulate myself well, because yeah, I just feel like in some suicidal cases, people killed themself in order to like let their voice be heard because once you're dead is like, oh, everyone cares about you and their attention is put on to that particular person and then that people are able to understand maybe why they killed himself and then people start showing love to that person and then start saying 'oh, maybe if I had known', but then again that person may have tried to express themself to you, but you haven't been listening or trying to relate, which may have made them feel lonely. So not, so not being paid attention to or not being listened to... Yeah, because a lot of the time, yeah, I feel like people keep going through stuff all the time, but I feel like being able to talk to someone may reduce the level of stress that that person might be going through or may be able to like stop the feeling of loneliness, but if you're unable to do that and it's becoming a built-up thing, that can like take up the whole of you and can literally lead to like depression, I feel like depression, sometimes people may not know they have depression, so it can go often go um, unnoticed and then a person may start to act out unusually, which again leads to that stuff relating around the idea of suicidal, um suicide, yeah, so maybe like self-harming, yeah. You mentioned suicide quite a bit, can you tell me more about that? I feel like the idea of suicide kind of came from not, like a movie series I've watched and I feel like a lot of the time, in that movie a girl was going through, was going through something, she was unable to express herself and she cried out for help multiple times for like members of her family, school, um, um, what are they called? (min 34:40) and like her friends and no one tried to listen or they tried to undermine the situation and then her voice was only heard once she died, so I feel like people may feel like suicide is an easy option out, especially in that situations, whereby that particular person may feel strongly about the situation and they're just not being listened to, yeah. Yeah, *pause*, I do feel like a lot of people show love to people once they are dead, but then again it's too late, so I just feel like if a person was, if a person came to you once they were going through that experience, when they were alive, I don't, and you didn't pay attention, I just don't feel like you should act sympathetic towards the person after they are dead, because you, not to say that but like the whole responsibility is on that particular person, because I don't think that's fair at all, but I feel like you shouldn't play like you didn't know, I feel like there's an extent to which that person may hold or share a bit of responsibility, yeah. So you're saying that what's the point of paying attention to someone who's already dead, like you could have done this way before, but at the same time not making that person solely responsible. Yeah, um... yeah, like once the person, I feel like a person may show, especially like in suicidal cases of like, a person may show, may show that they're going through something, especially they try to talk to someone and that person is unable to relate to them or understand what they're saying and maybe, for example, they left a suicidal note and explained the reason why they died and all the time they've been trying to like explain that to someone else and people are just like minimizing the situation, not listening, and then is, once they died, they read the note, which is what they've been trying to say all along and then they try understand what the person's been going through and then like just feel sympathy, sympathetic to them now that they're dead, it's like what's the point when the person did try once they were alive, if that makes sense? Yeah. Okay. And how does that make you feel? I just feel like no one should feel like they have to kill themselves in order for their voice to be heard, but I do feel like the responsibility should, I feel like a bit of the responsability should be put on people who the person did try to talk out to, not all because you never know who, like you never know that someone is going to try to kill themselves, but I feel like if a person does try to come to you, no matter th-, no matter um, how little you may feel the situation is, I feel like the best thing for you to do is try to understand them and yeah, I feel like if you shoved the situation before, now that they're dead and they stated the reason why they killed themselves and it was the same situation, I feel like you should shove it then, you shouldn't now feel like it's important to you, when they did try to explain it to you previously, for like, that in itself is quite fake, because when they first came to you, that's the original way you felt about it, now, I just don't think that, I just don't feel like now that they're dead, you should alter the way you feel about it, because that's not true, you know deep down you feel a particular way about it, I don't think there's any sense in changing it now. Mmh, is there anything else you want to say? No. Okay, thank you. Interview 14, part 2 Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Person Interviewer Person Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Can we talk about what you've put first? I've put down youth clubs slash groups, I wrote being able, no being around others that are similar to you and being able to socialize. I feel like especially amongst the youth if you are able to socialize with other people within your social groups it's easier, I just feel like, you should always be around people that get you in a sense, so I feel like if a person from a working-class background went somewhere or someone went like socializing with maybe someone from a middle-class background, it's harder for them to socialize, in a sense that they're from two different backgrounds, not saying that it's impossible to happen, but I just feel like youth clubs in areas, maybe like working-class areas is ev-, easier for people to socialize, because they share like similar backgrounds and there's activities for them to um, feel connected within, yeah, yeah, I feel like being able to participate in games with other people allows connections to build, relationships to build, so that has like a positive outlook on... society and allows people to feel connected, because you're relating with people in your area and then again it just push forward both the idea of... ugh what's that called? *says in a lower voice*, like being socially connected within your area because yeah like you can, yeah, because there's like a place where everyone goes, where you could connect with one another and like socialize with each other. Mmh *pause*, you mentioned um, sort of being around people should stick to people that get them.. Pardon? You mentioned that, you know, you go there because you see people who get you or people should hang out with others that understand them, get them. Not neces-, not necessarily people that get you because I could have friends that I'm really close with that at first I wouldn't thought that we may understand each other, I just feel like it may be easier to maybe socialize and like become friends with someone that's from the same background, 'cause it may be easier for them to connect, like connect between the two, so I feel like youth clubs are mostly in situation and areas, so within that area you may have friends that only go to the same school as you and maybe, maybe you haven't spoken to and when you are at the youth club, you can speak to that same person and then socialize with them through like the whole activities they may have, be able to like understand that that person is similar to you and then create a friendship. You mentioned it's easier to hang out with someone who gets you. Yeah. I didn't quite understand it, so can you tell me more about that? Um... I feel like, I was talking about class differences, so um, a person from a working-class background may find it easier to, um sorry, to confide in someone who is also from a working-class background, because um, I feel like, maybe, let's talk about the cost of education, so, if a parent is unable to get a tutor for their child, and maybe like a middle-class parent is able to do that, then that child may feel like put down in a sense, because they know that their parent is unable to provide for them with the extras that the middle-class families can offer and then children are going to be children at the end of day, so maybe a child may react maybe, not maybe like in an intentionally mean way, but may like... may stunt on the fact that they have extra opportunities than the working class, so that child from the working-class background may not necessarily understand or get along with the other child, whereas they would with another child from another working-class background if that makes sense, yeah. And um, and how does that make you feel, like seeing that another child from a middle-class family can afford something that you may not afford? Hmm, *pause*, I feel like you can't fault the child because they're children and children at the end of day and I feel like if one parent can afford it and one parent can't afford it that's just the way of life, like people out there are unable to provide for themselves and like they're always in, there's always someone else in a worse situation than you and I feel like everyone should just be grateful for what they have, because someone's always worse off, yeah. *long pause* Ehm... Do you want me to move on? I was going to ask you a question about the um, about that section, when you go to these youth clubs, is it youth clubs? Yeah. Youth club, right, you are socializing with people that um, that you might know, for example... Yeah. Tell me about, like, the feelings that you might, you know, get when you're there because you said this is the place where you feel most socially connected, how do you feel when you go there? Or when you're there? Um... a lot of youth clubs, I feel like um a lot of youth clubs accommodate from children from like really young ages, maybe around the ages of, like really, really young ages from, so from really young ages, and parents are able to send their children know that, knowing that they're in um the care of another adult, so I feel like knowing... one second, I feel like um, yeah, I feel like being in an atmosphere where other children are also like enjoying, just enjoying themselves, playing games and like having fun, allows relationships to form, because your friend may also go there and like maybe a person like, if there's a youth club in an area where crime rates may be higher, a parent may send a child there because they know they're being, they're under the protection of an adult, so children can go there and try and like mingle, and like socialize with one another, I don't really know if I am explaining myself properly... but yeah it's like an opportunity for people to be in a secure location, where they're able to participate in activities and feel like socially connected because they're around friends and people they trust and they're just having fun, essentially, yeah. You mentioned crime... Yeah. And safety, can you tell me more about that? Um, what I was trying to say was, I feel like, um... parents may rather send their child to youth clubs, rather than send them to a park, whereas like an open space, I feel like simply because youth clubs are supervised by adults and like trained support workers, so that in itself just means that it's more secure, yeah, it means that it's more secure and parents don't really worry about the situation because they know that it's less likely for crime to happen in a secure location, yeah. And how do you, how does it make you feel? Um... *pause*, I feel like having places like youth clubs where people are able to feel safe is like beneficial for that particular area, which is good for children, yeah. Thank you, is there anything else you want to say about that? No. Okay, can we talk about what you've put here, please? I've put um schools, but also, I've put it in the middle because it can be both positive and negative, in the sense that it allows children to interact and socialize with one another positively and negatively that some children may feel excluded or outcasted, so yeah it has both negative and positive impacts *pause*. Can you tell me more about that? Um... positively schools can allow children to feel socially connected, when they communicate and talk with one another and negatively, if a person's being excluded, they will obviously feel lonely because they're unable to confide in other children and like relate to other people, so that loneliness may lead to other things, which we've linked to previously, but yeah it affects them both, it can affect a person both positively and negatively. So you're saying that school environment can make one, can make you feel lonely because, you know, there might be other students that, um, they may not understand you. Yeah, to an extent, so if a child is unable to fit in, then they will feel lonely, but at the same time children who are able to form bonds, are able to socialize with other people, so may have like a positive outlook on schools in comparison to that child, who is unable to form bonds and like make friends, and then they just feel like excluded and unable to fit in, so like that school environment for them is a negative thing, rather than a positive thing. Mmh, sorry, can you mention the last bit again? Hmm, so the outlook on schools may be seen as a negative thing rather than a positive thing because they're unable to form, like socially *gets interrupted* Um, I'm really sorry, is it, these interviews are meant to be private, is it ok? I think we're gonna be done in five minutes, is that okay if we um... *refers to some who has entered the room* Mmh? Is that okay if we keep this in a private setting? Oh yeah, sure. Sorry, I think um..., is that okay, we just need five more minutes? *says to someone else who entered the room* Yeah, give me a second. Thank you, appreciate it. Of course. *noises of drawers in the background* Sorry about that. It's alright, you wanna carry on? Ehm, yeah, what I was saying was that... Are you feeling okay, by the way? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine, yeah, a negative environment in schools may be like, a children may feel outcasted, unable to form social bonds, may feel like they're not fitting in with the other students and then that may lead to the idea of loneliness, because you're around children your age group and if you're not fitting in, you may start to think 'oh, maybe something's wrong with me', but then, on the other hand, schools are an opportunity for children to interact and form relationships and bonds, like a lot of people can form lifelong relationships from their school friends and that in itself is positive and may allow a person to feel socially connected. So when you mentioned something around, you know, students not, people trying to fit in in school, there might be, um, issues around fitting in and stuff, can you tell me more about that? I feel like a lot of the time in schools you have like a majority and the minority, so for example within a school you may feel like 'oh there's a particular way to behave or act or way of thinking or doing because the majority is doing that' and then the minority will feel like, um, like they may feel like, 'oh, this is maybe how society is and if I'm not fitting in school, am I going to fit in, once I leave s-, fit in in society once I leave school?' and then that just leads to the idea of loneliness because them-, themselves just feel like they're an outcast because they aren't able to fit in with children their own age, so they might be worried about how the future is like, if they're able to make friendships in the future. And how does that make you feel? Um... I feel like *pause* schools, I feel like children in schools can be very mean at times and like maybe, like maybe if a person feels like they don't belong, which in a sense isn't right, because at the end of the day when school is over that person has their whole life to look forward to and a lot of things may come their way that you never thought may come their way and yeah, I just don't think the impact of school should follow them once they leave school, because the school environment and the outside world are like two different things, yeah. You mentioned that, something like um, that if they don't find friendships within their own age group and the school, it's, it's worrying that they are not going to make friends later on in the future. Yeah, 'cause I feel like, um, schools may be seen as like a mini representation of the outside world, so it's like you have people from your particular area and people sharing like the same kind of like background as you and are around the same age group and you're unable to form bonds or like socialize with other people, so that person may feel like something's wrong with them or may feel like 'is this how, like a representation of what's going to be like in the future? Am I always going to have this like sense of loneliness because I'm unable to make friends now? Am I going to be unable to make friends in the future as well?', yeah. And how does that make you feel? I just feel like once you're in school, you may feel like your whole life revolves around that, but outside of school is like two completely different things and I feel like a person shouldn't limit themselves to feeling like the exclusion will last forever because you won't be lonely forever, yeah. And how does that make you feel? Being excluded? Um... *pause* if I was excluded... Yeah, not you particularly. If someone was excluded... me, personally, I don't like when people are excluded, I try like include everyone, so I feel like yeah, for me personally, if I see someone excluded, I always try include them, I don't think anyone should be left to feel like they're by themselves or feel dependent on themselves throughout their time in a school setting because it's just not right, I don't think anybody should be left to feel like it's just them and them only and yeah. *pause* Okay, thank you, is there anything else you want to say about this? No. Okay, thank you, I'm gonna cancel that."
