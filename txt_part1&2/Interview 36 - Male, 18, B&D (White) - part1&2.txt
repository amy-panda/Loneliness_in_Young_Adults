"Interview (Participant 36) – Male, 18, B&D (Parts 1 & 2) Key: I:Interviewer R:Respondent I:Can we start by talking about what you've put first please? R:Ah… so the first one being home alone I would say, Um…typically if you're home by yourself, and you have literally nothing to do. That could potentially make you feel lonely. Um…some people when they’re bored, they just tend to sleep, which probably be’cause they are lonely. Um sort of have to say that (unclear 0:35). And for the second one…… I:Before we move on to the second one, I want you tell a little bit deeper into the first one. R:Okay. I:So, you say being at home alone, um…can you tell me more about that? R:Um well…personally, from where I am, is just shared accommodation place. So, from just there, it's like obviously growing up a bit surrounded by family, and now I'm not just like… I'm literally alone by myself. I have my neighbours, but they keep themselves themselves, I don't bother them, they don’t bother me. I have no reason to speak with them so yeah…kind of feeling lonely that’s why I'm not at home all the time, I’m always out. Um tend to draw myself away from that, hang out with my friends, go to the park. But if I am, if it bothers downs having to stay at home, I feel lonely, typically alone by myself. That’s what I’m about say. I:So, it sounds like you know, you’re are home, that's what you feel alone ‘cause your family is not around you know, and your neighbours are keeping to themselves. R:Yeah, basically. I:How does that make you feel. R:Um…I don’t know. I kinda miss it. I kinda miss being around with my family. At the same time, I don’t ‘cause that’s the reason why I'm living there. But…yeah, I just miss having a group of people around me…all the time, which is again why I go out that’s why. I:How does that make you feel. R:Um…I don’t know. I kinda miss it. I kinda miss being around with my family. But at the same way I don’t ‘cause that’s the reason why I'm living there [laugh]. But…yeah, I just miss having a group of people around me…all the time, which is again why I go out when I was alone...yeah. That’s the furthest I can relate on that. I:And when you say that you know, when you like to go out with your friends to the park and then things like that. Can you tell me more about that? R:Well…ever since about year 9, year 10 of secondary school. We had this fascination of basketball. So, we had this really crappy court in the school and we just used to bring our cheap basketball that we could afford to this you know, we just used to pay around whatever and err… when we was able to, we go to the park and there’s an outdoor court in our local park that we go to, which is chill out. Most time we practice, get better. I have a friend who was 5 foot 8, and he could basically dunk on a 10-foot rim [laugh]. I'm 5 foot 11 and I can't [laugh]…so it's a bit like you know…I'm a bit envious with him. But yeah no it's just like um…yeah, we just chill out, we just casual for a (unclear 3:22) friends for ages. We’ve known for 6,7 years. Yes, crazy. Um…Looking to hang out with them the most. Uh I made new friends in my barber course, but we don't hang out like that ‘cause I only see them once a week. So, park or if we decided to make up a motive like go to cinema or go to the restaurant or something, go to raffle, go to town. I’m always with them, it…That being surrounded by people is…you know, I like that…It droves me away from the loneliness of being at home, yeah. I:So, when you say that you know you feel lonely at home, what kind of thoughts normally go through your head? R:Er…What my friends doing [laugh]. What my friends doing er…it’s only thing I can watch my phone. It’s just boredness. I end up having like couple showers a day ‘cause I'm bored or just go to sleep yeah…or draw. But yeah, just tend to just think of what my friends are doing. Message them, if they are busy it’s just like [sigh]. What am I supposed to do? Oh yeah. I:And when you say that you know, you got on your phone, can you tell me more about that? R:Um generally just got on Instagram most of the time. Uh…nothing like uh…nothing like looking at people's lives something else like that, but like me and my friend have this group chat where we just send memes. Do you know what meme is? I:Yeah. R:A meme is… I:On Instagram. R:It’s basically on Twitter, Facebook, it’s everywhere. It’s just a hysterical picture, to be honest [laugh], but it's relatable at the same time. So, (unclear 5:22), this just funny, funny sapphic. Can be picture or idea. Yeah which is literally have a group chat on the Instagram just for that reason. So, and…I'm a fan of anime, so I watch Dragonball Z, One Punch Man, Attack on Titan all that kind of stuff. So, I’ve got images, videos running into that on my Instagram. Look back old things I already seen…yeah. I said…going on YouTube watch a few youtubers um…play few games on my phone. Big fan of Marvel. I've got 3 like action adventure games of Marvel on my phone er…I like the idea of being in orders in games, so you do request, and you gain these materials to upgrade the characters you’ve already unlocked and stuff yeah. I enjoyed it with my friend. But most of the time, I spent time lazing on Instagram just looking at funny stuff [laugh]. I:And how that make you feel when you watch those funny stuff on Instagram or you going on Instagram in general? R:[Sigh] Relieve my boredom, I guess. (unclear 6:38). And same with drawing, I bring up an image on Google…just leave my phone next to me and just start to draw on a bit on a paper, copy an image. Just trying to release my boredom yeah. I:When you say you're bored and when you say it releases your boredom, can you tell me more about that? R:Oh it’s just like If I'm home alone and I’m bored. Obviously, I’m going to find something to do if that used to be looking at my friend on Instagram and that’s what I’ll do. It's just… I don’t get much to do. I have a TV but don’t really use it ‘cause nothing’s on that I wanted to watch until like 10:00 o'clock at night, ‘cause that’s when Family Guy’s on. But yeah (unclear 7:25). My room is just a room. There's not much to do or I can do is just use my phone or draw. Which really backs my point before is why I always, I’m out [Laugh]. And each day I leaves as early as I can and not come back to like midnight, to literally just sleep and go back out the next day. I:So, I assume you're living condition is not conducive for social interactions or it's making you feel lonely… R:Erm... I:You’re living in a room and… R:Yeah, yeah, yeah, kind of especially if my friends are busy which is erm…very recently has been the case. They were busy beforehand be’cause they were six form, doing A levels and stuff, so they couldn’t go out or do anything, they just spend their time studying. And erm…I don't have girlfriend or everything, so it's just the time…yeah the time more recently be’cause my friends are available and I’m not…the one who first moved in that was the case, ‘cause I have nothing to do. So yeah, I did feel lonely but then uh started reaching out to people who live in the same place, so my neighbours start talking to them. Sometimes I sit in the shared kitchen with the neighbors down stairs just sit and talk to them. I got to know them a bit. I'm a very social person like I would just say hi to everyone [laugh]. Some people are like…I was in the park with one of my friends once. Some girl walked over, and he dared me to go talk to her and I said, “alright”. I:What are you saying? R:He dared me to go talk to this girl, which is very pretty and stuff. I was like, “okay, I’ll spoke to her”. This is not a big deal [laugh]. So yeah, I was just a social person. I just interact with anyone…yeah. I:I'm just going back to little earlier where you say about missing your family and so on…What is it about the family that you missed? Can you tell me more about it? R:Um just interacting with them to be honest, just in general that being in the same house with them, having that company around even though I don't really speak to them. Just having that company around sort of missed erm… ‘cause my parents divorced when I was 6 or 7, and I live with my mum, didn't see my dad for 5 years, or my older brother. Er… it's me and my mom and my younger brother. She got remarried and then they came to me finish in primary school. So I said, I said I want to go living with my dad be’cause I found out what secondary school my brother went to, my older one. And wanted to go to the same one which 2 minutes from my dad’s house. So, I was…I want to go live with my dad now. So, stayed with him from the ages of 11 to 16, 17 when he hit me out. Didn't see my mom for the whole time. Um but myself was there in both houses, just enjoy having a company I guess…yeah just I'm used to it. ‘cause I've only been living in that place, shared accommodation, since October last year. So…16 years of living with family compared to not even here by myself is a massive difference, which just probably entail anyone to feel lonely but yeah. I:Okay sorry. And how do you feel not seeing your mom after that? R:After that time period? I:Yeah. R:Erm…I guess it don’t hit me as much as it supposed to. I just took it as it came. Uh there was a call holder set-up so I was able to visit her around the weekends, but my parents decided just stop doing ‘cause my parents was using us to help arguments with each other. So, we were like, dad said this, and mum said this. So, I was just like…which is stopped. And there's not like she couldn’t find me, I think. She could find my dad and speak to me, but she decided not to. So, I just figure out she don't how to deal with me. So, it didn't really bother me that much to be honest. But I (unclear 12:00) you know recently, so I visit my little brothers, he’s in (unclear 12:04) now. Erm yeah…just take it as a (unclear 12:08). Things don’t really hit me on. Just…just take it as it comes, yeah. I:Thank you. Is there anything else you want to say about that box? R:No, not first one. I:Can we start by talking about what you've put in second box please? R:The second box is a little drawing of what I get on the top right of my friend [laugh]. So erm…basically if I'm connected a Wi-Fi network, but the Wifi is down, I’m not sure, which will probably don’t. And I feel like people who are clingy to social media would feel lonely, depress, sad, unhappy if they can't use the Internet. Personally no, it’s not a problem ‘cause I've just got unlimited data [laugh] I don't need a Wi-Fi. But of general aspect of it, I feel like the people that I see on social media, I have a few of them on like Snapchat and it’s just like they post things on their stories every 2 minutes, every 5 seconds. I was just like, you don't need to do that. And I sit there and thinking like what if that wasn't a thing, what would you be doing with your life? So, I feel like when they have no internet, they just sitting ducks You know what I mean? I:Mm. R:I guess er…that's just my personal view…but yeah. I:So, what you're saying is people who really use social media often like Instagram, the minute for example they have don't have internet… R:They're panicking. I:Yeah, they're panicking, like life’s over. R:Yes, basically yeah. Which is the case for a lot of young people. Me personally is not a problem, I don't really care for it yeah. I:Mm. R:I think I definitely see it…with some people but yeah. I:When you say that you have nothing else to do, can you tell me more about that? R:Erm…sort of like er…their life is dependent and, they rely on the Internet. Um…again my personal view on that. So, literally be’cause they’re so used to have Internet around, they deferred their life to that. That's all they want to do, and it’s like…when it's gone, they… they just have nothing to do.  That’s the way I see anyways. They’re constantly on it 24, so it's just like…imagine a world without it, imagine something just disappeared, I feel like they would have nothing else to do. I:What do you think…what do you think it is about social media that really captures people? R:Um…social influences. People who post pictures of these fake bodies that are unattainable, and girls were just like, “I wish I had that”, erm…or people who posts their lives on YouTube would be like, “I’m rich” and this and that…There's also people like… they’re attracted to their aspirations is isn’t a bad thing. But it’s unrealistic, especially if you understand the situation, it's like this is not going to happen, it's not going to happen for you. So, and I know that so they will watch these people social influences to get I guess a taste of what it would feel like…yeah it's such social…social network places a big role on the young people be’cause it’s like it gives us the option to share our lives as well although it may not be as good as famous people or social influences. It's like their lives just be better than others and they wanted to show off as well. Erm…for example more recently ‘cause it’s summer now, a few of the friends I have on Snapchat, they’re on airplanes. I've never been on a holiday. So, I was just like, “Oh man! I wish I went.” You know they were in like Malibu or Miami, Spain. I'm just here. You know it's just like is their way of expressing themselves…yeah differently be’cause big part of our lives. I:So, it sounds like what you were saying is [sign] Instagram or Snapchat or the social media sites are platform the people to show off. R:Show off yeah basically. I:About… or express how they…yeah. R:Yeah…just to express. That’s not the case for everyone, but I guess the majority. [Sigh] I mean if I…recently I went to London, with like a nice camera, took a few pictures and put it on my Instagram. But (unclear 17:51) they look nice and there's another thing…uh people tend to laugh at you if you don't have a certain amount of followers. You become a laughing spot if you have less of a thousand. Also, especially if you're following more people than people that are following you, it’s a big problem apparently. For me I follow like 4000 accounts and I've got 1400 followers that it doesn’t bother me be’cause the accounts that I follow relate back to memes [laugh]- funny images or videos, and also my friends. But yeah…sort of the case for everyone. It's just (unclear 18:41) they’re just generating sluts to show off and post things for what we call “clout” which is just attention, it's basically attention seeking. they post certain things be’cause they want people to message them about them and be like, “Wow, that's cool!”, “Oh you look nice!”. They did it for a specific reason be’cause they want the attention…yeah. I:When you say they want attention, can you tell me more? R:Oh I guess it's just makes them feel better about themselves. People who are socially awkward in real life, person-to-person, are more active socially ‘cause it's easier to text someone. It’s is always easier to text someone than to speak to someone. So, I guess it makes them feel better about themselves when someone is commenting on their pictures or say that they look nice or something. Yeah I guess it's just feel happy, fulfilled. Yeah. I:How about you? How does it make you feel when someone comments on or messages you privately… R:Oh they don’t [laugh]. I've never had that but this doesn’t bother me. I get Likes and stuff. People like my pictures, but the amount that I get doesn't really bother me. It ranges from about 40 to 60 Likes per image and you know overtime ‘cause I don't really post that much to the point. But erm…if I have a good picture, okay I look good on this picture I’ll post it. Er I think generated 60 Likes I get and I see…girls always have more likes than boys, especially if they’re pretty. And it’s like a few of my friends, same age as me, 18, they’ll get thousands of Likes, sometimes hundreds of thousands. There are 18 and they're not famous…they barely have any followers and they get that many Likes, and it's just be’cause they look nice. And the thing with boys, I mean I guess some boys care about (unclear 20:01). It's just like if someone has comment on my picture I’ll be like okay, say thank you. I won’t be, “Wow! That's great.” I won’t be overwhelmed with joy ‘cause it's just a recurring thing really, isn't it? Every picture you post gets a Like, it’s repetitive. I'm not going to be excited be’cause someone commented even though no one does on my images…’cause I just take it down. If someone comments I’ll take it down…’cause most of the comments I get is just my friends taking the piss [laugh]. Just take it down. It doesn't bother me, take it off yeah. For some people it's a feeling of being noticed yeah, especially in my generation and younger. I:And what do you think that means? R:What you mean? I:The feeling of being notice or the feeling of wanting to be noticed. R:What do I think it means? I:Yeah. R:Erm…I’m not really sure to be honest [sigh]. I guess one way to put it social media is a popularity contest. Just like before there was social media in like secondary school, people would find ways to raise their status in the school like who is the coolest person, who is the most popular person. You know, it's just like…that’s what it is, it’s just a popularity contest. And obviously, if this person had more followers than this person, then this person can say to the one with less followers, “Haha, I’ve got more followers than you!”. But it’s not big…you don’t notice people? How many of those people that follow you do you actually know?...Do you know what I mean? It's just…it's pointless, which is why I don't really care how many I have…but yeah. I:So what you were saying is basically a lot of the people that followed are not actually your friend, they’re just random people? R:Yeah, that's even my Instagram. A lot of people like everything [sigh] ‘cause erm…we are all connected in some way, but we don't physically know them. So, people that follow me, obviously the people that I follow and meme accounts, I don't know who they are. They just put funny shit [sigh] and it's just like okay. And but er…a few people that followed me know people that I know or I know people that they know. And then the end you do get the odd feel of random people from actually nowhere, they're not involved in your social group. They don't live in your area, they just abroad maybe. But yeah…that's the case most of the time especially with girls that I know, just a lot of perverts to be honest [laugh] lots of them 13-year-old, 14-year-old yeah. I:You also mentioned earlier that when your friends, for example, when they traveled to Miami, Spain, Malibu etc. And they posted picture and then you said you wish that you could travel something. How does it make you feel when you see on social media things that people do or friends do that you don’t or you can't do yourself? R:Uh I guess it's just erm…like I said before, things don’t really hit me that hard. Uh…I'm not a very emotional person but say if my friend from Portugal ‘cause he visits there most summers, and he just sent pictures, “look at this beach” and stuff and I answered, “Wow! It looks very nice!”. Yeah, I wish I could be there, but I know with my circumstances I can't afford to go there so it's more so…for me, if I see someone on social media in a different country, I have a mental “to do list” I’ll be like okay, when I can, I'm going to go there as well…or an activity like even in this country Top golf or something, I've been to there before but just an example er…or Go kart racing or something. Wow that's cool, I'll do that as well…but in time. So, I mean I guess I do feel a little bit of jealousy, but it's just I'm probably be like yeah, when I can, I’ll do that as well. Be’cause it looks nice. But yeah. I:Is there anything else you want to say? R:I guess pretty much like I say [laugh]. I:Thank you. Can you start by talking about what you’ve put in the third box please? R:Not having any friends erm…okay. I can link this back to the second box, about popularity contest. Er… so, I tend to notice, I used to notice when I was in secondary school er…that people would define themselves into groups and so you'd have the black group- every single person is from an African region Caribbean region or even some cases they're Italians well, obviously (unclear 27:10). So, you have the black group and then you have the emo kids, the weirdos and then there be like this group of strange people like mental issues and stuff erm…I think you have the actually disabled people and people like me who are no popular as popular people but not as not popular as the lots of popular people like in between. And that’s where me and my friends were, we were just, we were known, everyone knew who we were, we just hang out with the popular people. And I used to notice bunch of people walking by themselves all the time. There's this one kid I remember who literally got to the point where he would volunteer to help teachers, but he had no friends. But he was that lonely that he hang out with teachers. So, we’re just like, again it's not personal thing, we all have friends [laugh] but just noticing people that don't, is like [sigh] but then yeah I guess I am infamous a lot by society be’cause I never would have spoken to that person just be’cause here is what we say a “loner”. I never go up to that person to speak to him be’cause then your status goes down and obviously, I didn't want that to happen…but yeah it's just like he used to go and help out the guy in the library, teacher library in library, math teaches, English, everyone. He’s always by himself erm…so yes pretty much that aspects of that third box by having any friends would like, it never makes you lonely. I:So, it sounds like what you're saying is when you're in your high school, you have like the popular kids and you got like the semi-point, in between. R:Yeah. I:So how does that make you feel in this sort of… R:Segregation? I:Yeah. R:Erm…I don't know. I guess again in this case I was, ‘cause if you don't want to hang out with some people, if you don't want to chill with some people you don’t, that’s it, so that’s it. And erm…I guess the high-status people, the really popular people, they were like look at us, you can’t step to us, you can’t tell us what to do ‘cause we know everyone and everyone knows who we are. And the “in between people” like us which is like I [laugh] just don’t really care. We just mingle with each other and we speak to each other. We might hang out with someone at school, we might only hang out inside of school, but we still mingle, you know. Erm…the segregation didn't really affect me in any way. Um…I tried to chill with as many people as I could, you know ‘cause I don't want to be the “loner” [laugh]. It's just…whatever really. If you choose to hang out with these people ‘cause you think that that's what you gonna do than that’s what you're gonna do. You know, I can't speak for other people's parts or their thoughts, their views. But yeah it’s same for most schools ‘cause bunch of my primary school friends went to pretty different secondary school than I did it but I still have them on social media and literally we just see the whole same things just happening. It’s the same in every school in the borough, in the city there’s always be celebration, not by force, but by extern, be’cause they feel like that should they get along with more. You know you see someone you like, I get along with you. You know you start talking to them like hey I just like that basically (unclear 31:39). I get along with everyone. I:Sometimes this called segregation…I'm just trying to understand the connection with that loneliness. R:I was just saying that like if you don't fit in if you're the person that doesn't have any friends, er…so segregation happened. Everyone’s found their part in school and you’re just the one that don’t fit in anything, you know and then that would make you feel lonely be’cause you can't talk with anyone be’cause no one shares any, anything with you like, they don't like what you like, they don’t do what you do…so you’d feel like pushed away, which is the case that person I said before. You just always hang out with teaches be’cause you had no one to relate to yeah. Everyone had already chose their group, they don't segregate themselves and you acting like an outcast yeah. That's what I was trying to say. I:And…and I don't know if I got this feeling right I don't know but it sounded like you wanted to help him, but at the same time you felt like if you don’t wanna be associated with, or being seen with him ‘cause he’s an “loner”, that may affect your sort of erm…reputation. R:Reputation yeah basically. Looking back in an hour I should have been like, you should come and join us or something, come speak with us, come sit with us and we’ll eat lunch. But at the time it was just different, you can…everyone can look back and say I could have done this differently. But in the moment, you just like nah…um ‘cause everyone just questioning you, why you're talking to him for, why hanging out with him for. It's just I don't want to hassle. You know, you don’t want anything bad, negative. It's just like I would let him do what he wants to do and switch it out in my head and thought, if he wants to hang out with us, then he would have spoken to us first. But yeah looking back, I should have been like, “hi” [laugh]. But yeah, I do socialize with everyone but be’cause he was that person that didn't fit in anything, no one shared anything common with him just like [sigh]. If you want a friend, you should come and speak to us yeah. I:Yeah so it sounds like you really value your reputation at the time and… R:At the time yeah, but after throughout the years, just tends to lose connections with people and don't want to talk with some people. Literally any people I talk to are from my secondary school is the group of friends I was with during school. When I was in school, I spoke to everyone apart from the “loner” [laugh]. I spoke to everyone, it’s just like even though I text everyone, but after year 11, when everyone went their separate ways…it just swoosh! Just this group of my mine boys, facet [laugh] all of us, nine of us, would have group chat on Whatsapp, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook everything, all the same people. And each social platform has its own purpose as well. But yeah, at a time I devalue my reputation and again looking back, I shouldn’t have done so much be’cause it's very much different now yeah. I:It sounds like you also didn’t want to judge… R:People did. People spread rumors about me. Again, things don't hit me hard. And just it happens. You know, people spread rumours, other people that I know as well. It’s just happens in it in life…but yeah. You can judge me, I don’t care. If you seem to think that I got one, I'm beginning another, or my nose is slightly twisted, just like…it's not…just like…just in case…just an example okay? No one’s perfect laugh so it's okay it’s…and that's school and it will happen. I:Is there anything else you wanna say about that box? R:I think I’m done now. I:Thank you can you start by talking about what you’ve put in the final one please? R:Final box, procrastinating. So that would also link back to the first, second box. Where being home alone, you’re bored. When there’s no Wi-Fi, you're bored. so uh obviously you know procrastination is just you just doing something else to avoid something else. Erm…in some cases, I feeling this personally er…all the way through primary school and then first two years of secondary school, I was the smartest child in the school. Uh…top sets everything, top pass everything, get highest grades everything. But, after the second year of secondary school, I start year 9, the work starts to get a bit more complicated and everything's starting to changing. I was kind of finding it hard to get the grips with it and so I push away from education, and found that my procrastination was the time with my friends more rather than to study, or do work I was supposed to do. So, my grades started to dim down a bit. And I didn’t went through my GCSE either. So I guess what I'm trying to say is if I didn't spend my time with my friends, and focus back on my studies, I could potentially lived more to be loney be’cause my friends out doing this and that, hanging out and I’m like, I don't want to do it. It would be loneliness by choice, which is completely different to general loneliness. It will be loneliness by choice be’cause back in the day, I used to be a real geek. I was just like math questions always the first one to put my hand up everything, but then I guess I don't know, I just sort as, it’s not really cool to do that. Again, status thing. Erm…yeah it's the best I can describe it. Loneliness by choice, if I decided to carry on working hard, then I would have lost my friends, which is probably what I thought at the time, which is why I started hanging out with my friends, if you get what I'm saying. I:So, it sounds like what you're saying is, in the one hand you wanted to study, but on the other hand, you don't want to lose your friends be’cause that could have meant that you’ll be feeling lonely. R:Be’cause I don’t have my (unclear 40:12). Obviously looking back now, it’s a bit silly ‘cause uh my friends used to tell me, I, you have to revise, you have to you know, do your revision. ‘cause they were doing it but I just like (unclear 40:31). Had a girlfriend at that time as well, fascination. I: [laugh] R:And it's just like there were off-school revision sessions. But I was, I wanna see my girlfriend yeah so…Also, that aspect relationship-wise probably…would have never got a girlfriend you know. I:Probably would not what? R:Probably would have never got a girlfriend. So… I:And if why? R:And if I carry on study…erm if I stayed behind for revision classes um…which also like before, self-fulfilled loneliness [laugh]. This is much as I can get, elaborate on that…I was thinking about that the fourth option a while, and It just came to me quickly and this is as much I can remember on that one. I:You know when you said you were at home for example, there's no, there's nothing to do that you kind of procrastinated by doing something else. Can you tell me about that? R:Um I don't know really. I guess linking back to first and the second one. If you're bored, you just find something to do. But especially if it's something that…if something that you can do something that bores you then obviously find something that is not gonna be boring, for example homework. I never done a piece of homework in my life. My dad was so adamant that schoolwork was for school, not for home, and this whole thing about it. So, I never did a piece of work ever. And I guess that also affected my grades and stuff but uh [sigh]…so I guess when my friends were to procrastinate from homework, I procrastinate from work in school during school ‘cause I wasn't doing any homework. There wasn't anything for me to procrastinate. I wasn't doing anything boring at home, but which should let me to find general lessons in school boring, so I just mess around. I remember doing maths year 9 [laugh]. Maths year 9 was…I was like the class clown and it's just like my teacher was from Guyana, which is south America. And we used to make fun of him ‘cause he had a triangular shaped head. His skull would comes a point which we make fun of him, his hand gestures and the stuff that he says, the accent. You know just…I guess that procrastination was humor. Didn't want to do the work, so I just made everyone laugh [laugh]. And I remember one time I didn't even walk in the classroom and he stopped me from walking in, and he was like, “go away” [laugh]. Yeah it was the last troll and that was it. I moved to a different classroom. But yeah so… That’s the best way to put it. I:And how does it make you feel in procrastinating? R:Erm…less bored. I feel like 'cause the work that was hard to…I found it difficult and it was like stress me out. So, I get it was stress relief 'cause I was fighting it with humor and the fact that I was making everyone else laugh, literally the whole class. It was just like ha [laugh]! I:[laugh] R:You know, stress was gone but then it hit me hard when I moved down to, ‘cause that’s top set, first set class and I got moved down to second set, which is not so smart. It's still smart but you know, you just not tops it. And I wasn’t understanding things that I should have been understanding. Erm…so that kind of hit me I was just, “Oh man, I'm bad at this, I’m bad at this.“ Back at the time it was just like stress relief ‘cause the work was so difficult I couldn’t bear it, but yeah. I:You said you were better than this as in your skills are better than what? R:Yeah, I can, you know…basically see myself being able to do the work. So, I just remember being this mock trial, there’s this ongoing battle of these mocks as we meet throughout the kids. And it's just like sometimes I won’t always come up, most of the time I always come out on top, especially in science. You used to get these little booklets testings every month and the highest grade you can get was a 7A. I get that all the time. Every single time, 7A. First as I did, in my first time I got like a 5, but it’s still pretty good for your first time. Now there was 6B ‘cause it was rated it as a small. 7C being the lowest 7 and 7A being the highest 7. So I've got 5C, 6B and then 7A, A, A, A, A, A, A [laugh]. One time I got 7B, and then I got 7A [laugh]. All the time science. So, I was looking back at it, and I was like…what happened yeah…but yeah. I:How does it make you feel? R:Well I couldn’t do the work erm… dumb. Especially bring in second set as well. I mean most people in there weren’t intellectual anyways. So, I’m smarter than all of them, but still couldn't do the work. It made me feel dumb, I guess. So then I started to crack down a little bit more, starting to get a little bit high grades, Cs, which is pass. Just didn’t work as hard as I used to. So, I guess I used to feel like I wish I had that mentality…but again yeah, I had a girlfriend [laugh]. But yeah so I guess what I can say for that is…um finding ways to get out of boring situations which is the procrastination…to then remove that loneliness from your life to sign up basically ‘cause if I hadn't done those things, I felt right, I would be alone. I’m gonna have no friends, everyone would just see me as that nerd, a nerd at everything you know that. Yeah, with humor and more interesting things, I avoided self-fulfilled it loneliness. I:Avoided what? R:Self-inflicted loneliness. I:And right now you avoid loneliness by going to on Instagram for example? R:No, no, no, no, no. I avoided loneliness by going out with my friends. I:‘Cause usually when you’re at home for example, do you usually go on Instagram to just get rid of loneliness? R:It doesn't really help me stop feeling lonely. I guess it draws my attention away from it, but I wouldn't really feel like…I if I was to use social media for instance Instagram it’s not the same feeling as being accompanied by my friends. So, I guess I’d stop thinking about it, but it wouldn't make me feel less lonely, if you get what I'm saying…'cause it's just like …it just draws my attention away from it, watching the funny stuff like a TV show I’m really into or anime or something, and then erm…until my friends are available, it’s cool [laugh]. I:What is it about your friends erm…meeting your friends that you say that it's not the same when you meet your friends going on social media. Can you tell me more about that? R:I guess because I’ve known them for a long time it’s like we have so many things in common, we relate so many things and we can just talk to each other and be like, “Oh yeah! That happen to me too, that's cool!” and we’re like, just a social interaction with them. I've wound (unclear 50:13) with joy and stuff and you know, happy to be with my friends. Whereas using Instagram, I watch a funny video, I’m like, “Oh…haha”. But with my friends I can like roll on the floor laughing I can just literally laugh out loud because we all know what makes each other laugh. Like we have inside jokes. You can’t have an inside joke with your phone screen [laugh], which is a massive difference so yeah. I:So, it sounds like you can do a lot of things with your friends that you cannot do on social media. R:I can't play basketball with my friend. I can't play Cards Against Humanity on my phone I can't play Monopoly or board games on my phone. I just tap the buttons on the screen. It's [sigh] I don't really see the point using a phone to be honest [laugh]. I just use it for people to call me or my friends. I’d literally rather spend time with my friends than go clubbing and post it all over social media. I:How does that make you feel when you see your friends or other people posting pictures of them being at the club? R:It’s like, “Okay, you're an alcoholic.” [laugh]. If that's your past time, then let that be your pastime. I don't like clubs, so it doesn't bother me. I never been to any of them ‘cause I’ve recently turned 18. But personally I just don't like the idea of it 'cause I’ve seen people’s videos, there’s this massive crowded place, everyone’s touching each other’s bodies like you don't know these people are. And it's just like I don't know the whole idea of it, but I guess once I go I’ll like it [laugh]. But for now, from what I’ve seen, nah…I'd rather just hang out with my friends…play basketball. I:Is there anything else you want to say? R:I guess I’m done. (End of recording) Interview (Participant 36) – Male, 18, B&D Key: I:Interviewer R:Respondent I:Okay erm…this is Part 2, can we start by talking about what you've put in box one please? R:Um…places you feel much social connected erm…so the basketball court at the park. I feel more socially connected because although most of the time I go with my friends, the other people that go there, everyone call each other, everyone says hello to everyone, and it's like…even if they don't know who you are, you get spark the handshake you know, or the nod, or the hello because we’re just like we're all there for the same reason. And it’s like you know people, random people come to play a game, 2 versus 2, or 4 on 4 something like that. We don't know who they are, but because it's…obviously it’s a public place, we’re there for the same reason. That’s why I feel socially connected because it's like we're playing basketball and we know each other for years [laugh]. And eventually we get that chemistry whilst we’re playing a game. You know, like passing the ball and…directing people like what's going on, I’ll go that way…you know…it’s just like that instant connection [flick] you know. That's why I feel socially connected because yeah, with my longtime knowing friends, but I've connected with other people that I don't know. And so now I want to go back to the park, those people that I’ve met, we're now friends. we don't hang out other than that we're friends because of the court. Erm…that’s what I’m gonna say for that…and the second one… I:Oh, before we move on to the second one, I just have some questions. So, it sounds like what you're saying is because there’s that common purpose that you have with other people, i.e. it’s gonna be basketball, that helps you connect with the…that helps… R:Yeah, that make sense. We all share that interest, we all want to be able to perfect our skills and get better at the sport in general because we all…we  all want to do that and we all know that we want to do that even though there are people that are way better than us. I:[laugh] R:It's good to play with people better than you, that's how you get better. You can't play with someone who’s at the same level or lower 'cause you’ll feel like you’re good, but then you play against a pro you're not, you know. There’s always this little wingians who are like…they’re just amazing. Somewhere just like (unclear 2:48) like, what we’re supposed to do [laugh]? But yeah, because we all desire the same thing. That's why we feel socially connected. I:And how does that make you feel when you’re there? R:Just [sigh]…I guess included? Erm…I haven’t played basketball for awhile, again recently I started, again. So, I guess I just feel included to be honest. Erm…it's not a big dea. Er…I get tired really easily, so I sat out most of time, watching them play. I'm playing is just like…you know…I took off anyone anyway, I took off anyone anyway so…it’s just like, you know, general day [laugh]. I:And when you say you feel included, can you tell me more about that? R:Um…no, I don’t think I can. I don't have to elaborate on that. I don't have to elaborate that but I just feel included. That's the best way I can describe it. I:So when you say included like…I'm just trying to understand, is it that ‘cause you share something with other people that they…yeah everyone's you know everyone quite well. R:Yeah I've been accepted as someone who can play basketball, just like they’ve asked me to join their team. You know 'cause a few people were they like…they’ll look at certain people and be like, okay no, he's not that good. So, I won’t ask him. So, if they decided to choose me over someone else, I’ll be just like…that’s what I mean by feeling included as well. But yeah, generally sharing the same uh…passion for basketball. I:How does that make you feel when you’re included? R:I don’t know how to explain [laugh]. Erm…I don't know, just happy, I guess. Because I know that I'm better than other people, certain people, not all of them, but like obviously there’re rather people needing some 11-year-old [laugh]. So, it's just like alright, but I don't know, I don't know how to explain it. I:What else did you write here? R:Work place, so my place of work. Being a barber, I work at a shop on Saturdays. I was with other barbers there. So again back to the bustle thing, because we er…actually I'm gonna say for the third thing as well. Work place and college because both are student barbering. Erm…the college especially because we're all young people trying to learn the skills required to be a barber. And also again, because we all share that passion, I can click with them socially which is alright. Work place are well, my boss and the other person that works there, get along really well. You know, it's surprisingly you never know, nearly 10 years older than me, we have a lot of things in common. You know, we like Smurflings and stuff. I like it when they…'cause i think I’ve mention earlier, I'm a fan of Marvel. And like…they’ll go watch a Marvel movie, they know that I know about it. So, they’ll come and ask me questions like, “how does it happen, this happen?” and I was like, “Okay, sit down.” [laugh] “Let me explain”. They’re just like, you know. But yeah, all three of these things basketball, workplace, college, I feel socially connected 'cause everyone else there shares the same passion as me. So, we can get along socially. I:Is there anything else you got to say?... Thank you. Can we start by talking about the second box please? R:Second box, places you feel most lonely. And so again I feel lonely at my house. I'm not going into that detail 'cause I've spoken already, but yeah generally because I have no company around me, and I guess it's the same thing really I just pull similar things in both boxes erm…all three of the things I’ve put in box two, so my house, shopping centers and bus stops. I've got no company around me if I'm by myself, of course I’ll feel lonely. Erm…I guess shopping center is more like because I live on my own, I have to go and do my own food shopping and it's just like…it's just boring. I'm probably want to have someone with me erm..,and it's just like, I always feel like…I feel like I'm being watched 'cause I'm obviously, I don't know how people perceive me when I walk into a shop. It’s like I know I am younger but can they see that I’m 18 years old? Can they see that I'm younger than them? Do they look at me and say, “how come he's doing food shopping?” You know do they it? Erm…so because I’ve got no one to talk to, that made me feel lonely. And bus stops. So, I just hate waiting. I'm so impatient. You know, I’ll just use my Phone to pass the time. And again, all three of those things- my home, shopping centers and bus stops, I preferably have someone with me (unclear 9:17) at these places erm…because yeah, I do feel lonely otherwise … I:You say when you go grocery shopping, you wonder what people think of you. Can you tell me more about that? R:Erm most of the case are conditional, mainly about my circumstances. Obviously, they don't know I live by myself ‘cause they don't know my parents. I feel like I look older than I am, which I've been told and when I was 16, people used to think I was 19. [laugh]. I guess that’s not gonna be a good thing in the future 'cause I'll be 50 looking 80 [laugh]. But yeah I don’t know, I feel like they just like questioning why this young person is doing food shopping you know. If I was a much older person, if I saw, if I could tell someone is a teenager, how come he's doing food shopping without his parents? I guess from a personal thing I feel like that they would all, just general public would be asking the same question. I would ask if I'm older yeah. I:When you say that they will be asking… R:Like in their thoughts. But they’ll be asking themselves, how comes? I:What should be…I guess sometimes, trying to understand what you say that they would be thinking, what is this guy doing shopping, grocery shopping, come on. R:Like wow erm…because they would be able to tell that I’m much younger than them. I:So, what do you mean? R:So what I mean is, generally you can look at someone and be like, “okay, you’re definitely under 20 years old”, you know? Or you can look at someone and be like you're at mid-40s. Like you can generalize people’s ages just by looking at them, by their appearance. So, if you look at me…if I haven’t tell you that I was 18, how old do you think I am? I:Probably 21. R:21? I:22, 23. R:Yeah [cough]. Let me think a little bit about [laugh]. But if I was going to say this, out of my (unclear 11:43), which is just an (unclear 11:45) isn’t it? Erm yeah, I guess it's just people would look at me, and because you can look at someone and think they are this age. If they were to think, “okay, he's like 16. Why is he food shopping?”. You know because I mean you can’t tell me that you wouldn't question why a teenager was doing food shopping. Not to the point where it troubles, but like trying to understand why this person is doing that you know? Like just trying to fathom- “how come?”, you know? And then you just walk off, and get fresh air you know? It’s like erm…yeah. I:How does it make you feel when you walk in that shop and you feel like people are watching you? R:[yawning] Obviously, it's just like whatever really. But for the first time I did it, when I first moved in by myself when I was in food shopping, it was just like I feel like it was…all the eyes were on me, and erm…they were just like…thinking like to themselves, why a young person is doing food shopping? I just feel like everyone was turning on me just felt…I don’t like. People are staring me right in the soul. I don't like that. That's what I feel like but now I’m (unclear 13:16) ‘cause I've gone shopping numerous times. I was like in the same place, so I was just like, “whatever…don't bother me now”. Yeah I used to…first time I go by myself, I don’t like it. So, I have someone come with me, it made it easier I:And what about bus stops? R:I was just impatient. It’s like I hate Sundays 'cause it's the slowest TFL service ever in a week literally. If you miss the bus, it's going to be 20 minutes for the next one, 20 minutes. and that’s so long. It was such a long time to wait for a bus. Yeah especially like if you’re the only person in the bus stop, like, if there is like general public ground I mean, I’ll be alright, it’s fine. But if I’m the only person in the bus stop [laugh], yeah you just…not to an extreme extent by a little bit, a little bit lonely. No ‘cause it’s just people driving pass (unclear 14:40), some personal (unclear 14:43) [laugh]. Yeah same thing with the shopping. Sometimes like shops and stuff, people are looking at me like, what are you doing [laugh]? But it looks more normal when there's other people around the bus stop, there’s more than one person you know? Especially when that person is sitting on this [laugh], just staring. That is why I tend to do this with my friend. I'll call someone when I sort of, I feel lonely, but yeah. Just distracting someone at a bus stop for everyone looking at me. I:So it sounds like…so it sounds like it might bother you when people look at you. R:Yeah I don't really care what they think. But I don't really care what goes through their minds. But I just hate staring I can't stand it especially without a conversation and like why you're looking at? If I’m not having a conversation, why are you looking at me? You have no reason. It’s like I go to the gym recently. So annoying. I go to the gym recently. And I was on this assisted pull-up machine, and er…’cause I can’t do pull-ups ‘cause I weighted too much. But I was using it, and this guy like in front of the machine I’m using, on a different machine. He just staring at me like [sigh]. It throws me up again, and I mean like I'm in the mood like I'm working out. And like I just see him looking at me, can you not? Just like…[sigh]. I hate it. I don't know you, I'm not talking you. Stop staring at me. Eventually he got off the machine, he stood next to the machine I was using. What are you doing [laugh]? I just, I just…[laugh] some people kind of like [sigh] especially if I don't know or if I'm not having a conversation. I:If what? R:If I'm not having a conversation. I:What goes through your head when you see people staring at you? R:Can you die? [laugh] Nah, just um…I stopped question why they’re doing that. I’m like what’re you looking at? what is your problem? And what we you feel the need to stare at me? do you have a mental problem? [laugh] Is there something wrong with you mentally that cause you to disturb me? Do you disturb other people or is it just me? You know a bunch of questions it's just like…but also can you stop? [laugh] That’s what I’m thinking, I'm thinking, “can you stop staring at me?”. I want to say is erm…because I mean I guess most of the time I don’t realize they're doing it, you know? Um so that's why I'm not saying anything and I tend to just look somewhere else. But if it’s really bugging me, I’ll question it. I’ll have a bunch of questions coming up like the ones I've just said, do you have a mental problem? Why are you doing this? Do you stare other people? That kind of stuff. I:Is there anything else you want to say? R:I think I'm done. I:Thank you very much. (End of recording)"
