Right so, umm, what grabbed me was the word images. So, I did start off by just drawing a picture and it is just a standard is someone standing at window, umm, it's a nice sunny day outside and they are watching other kids or people, umm, playing catch or playing with the balls with one another and obviously the person’s got a sad face, that's just one, one experience of drawing this that I can think of, which I think growing up everyone can experience, because, um, I mean personally if you ask me, I think kids tend to be quite weird when they’re growing up and getting older, they've got weird tendencies, maybe things that they do when their kids that they wouldn't even think of doing when they're adults. So umm, I do think that is one, one kind of, one, one form of loneliness that people do experience and that comes to my mind. Umm, so that's number one, number two. Before we go on to number two, um so you're basically saying that if you know, some kid or someone is actually seeing other people playing at home and he or she is not with them, how, can you tell me more about that? Right, so, elaborate on that point, I mean, maybe someone... obviously this all boils down to the type of household this person in particular is coming from, in my idea in this picture, this person hasn't got too much kind of umm... How do I put this in words? Haven't got much of a support system at home? So, they don't really, they're not, they're not praised. So, I think children that aren't praised tend to be quite insecure and some children will find a way to find some form of security maybe from, particularly, I think young males in inner-city London will find, umm, ah, well I don’t want to say aggressive, but, like they might come off more aggressive than other children because they haven't got that nurturing and, and love at home, so I do think that is one way that they can choose to get out with it, but if that's not in them as a person then yeah, they will stand at a window wondering and pondering what to do and maybe, just not believing in themselves and thinking no one wants to be with me, that no one wants to play with me, mum and dad don’t even pay attention to me, so why those kids out there are gonna pay attention to me and maybe that person has, actually, attempted to go out, and have some fun, and they just stood there, they don't know what to do and other people viewing will be like ‘why is that person just standing there?’ and then it creates a vibe, do you know what I mean, so um that's where that picture kind of stems from and that's the bigger picture with that picture. So, is there… *gets interrupted* No, I haven't got any more points there *laughs*. Thank you. I was just going to say, so it seems you're saying that, um you know, someone who's essentially not supported at home or you know through, yeah, someone who's not, someone who's not believed in, someone who’s not supported, someone who's not encouraged, someone who, you know, they, they might be, you know, prone to feeling lonely. Yes. So how, how does that, how does that, how would that make them feel like or how does that make you feel? Me, personally? If you were in that context or… Well, the reason why I've drawn this picture is because me I come from a very strong support system at home and I’ve got a two-parent household, Mom and Dad have always praised me, I mean, I say my Mom and Dad praised me, but they've also kept me grounded as well, like I remember one time I started singing, I was 8 years old, and they tell me you can give it up, don't bother singing, it's not you, try something else. So, um, but then obviously growing up and obviously having had the life that I've had, which I'm very grateful for, I’ve had a brilliant childhood, I used to live in Spain for about six years, um but obviously the 2008 financial crash, we had to come back and, and obviously now having had my teenage years in inner-city London and having had experiences with certain friends, I know that your household does play a role in the person that you become as a young teenager and that does boil down to the amount of confidence that you have at that age. I think, like I said in my first point, some, some young people will gain th at confidence through a different that they will seek, a different kind of household unit, not within their own home, and then that brings out the constant in there, but if you don't find that, then I believe maybe that's when… I’ve kind of lost my point here, but that's, that's what, that's, that's how I've come up with the idea, because I've noticed with my strong support system at home, I do tend to doubt myself less when um having to perform a new task or something like that, compared to my other peers that I've noticed that with, that may not have had, as, as, haven't had as lucky as an experience with their childhood as I have but don't get me wrong, we’re still friends. *laughs* That doesn't, doesn't completely change the situation. So, so going back to that picture, so if that person sort of is not supported at home, um it's not encouraged, you know, who's not sort of, um their parents don't believe in them, how would that make them feel? Oh, you’d feel rubbish, wouldn’t you? This is what I’m saying, you’d either feel angry and you’d seek that household unit outside of your home and you might take to it like a fish to water but then, you might then see a household unit outside of your house, I do think that's far too much for me. So, it doesn't necessarily mean that he comes from a household, where his Mom and Dad are neglecting him and abusing him or whatever like that, I don’t even know why I’m talking about this, but what I'm trying to say is he might come from a household where they’re not very affectionate, his mom and dad are never showing him any affection and stuff like that, then I think if someone hasn't been shown love and affection, it affects your way of giving love and affection. So, I don't think, they might, they might not be very loving themselves, but then I feel like in each person there is still that, that, that fight to seek what you need. I think some people's lives are so clouded, it clouds their judgment and they don't know what it is until, I don’t know, a miraculous day comes along, they might meet someone that gives them that drive. Do you know what I mean? Mmh. ‘Cause I feel like, I think especially parents, parents can especially in kids growing up, they can put that certain ideas into their heads and I think if those certain ideas weren’t in their heads, they'd maybe excel than what they’re currently doing, do you know what I mean? Um, but yeah, I feel like they could either feel one way about it and go and seek that household unit themselves or they could, it could wear and tear and, I don't know, come on, there, there's like an epidemic with depression and stuff like that, isn't it? In this country? There is plenty of kids I went to school with and everyone was taking SSRIs and stuff like that and I can say quite a few of them didn't come from the strongest house-hold unit. Mmm, so, yeah. Okay, thank you. Is that what you were looking for? Yeah, sure, thank you. You want to say anything else? No, not really about that picture. That's just one form of loneliness, I suppose we could kind of put that into a coming of age category. Some people might, they might lead on into adult life and then, I think loneliness, uuh I don't want to get too deep into it, but I think you need this information, I think if someone, like we said, if they don't seek that household unit and then they don't come across that person that gives them that lift, it can turn into a very detrimental situation that could turn into a very, um maybe not so much impulsive person, more calculated, that have a hate for the world and which is not good in any way, shape or form, in my opinion. And that's it, I'm done with picture one. You mentioned that basically you had some of your friends who came from really good family, they had a lot of support yet, they were still on some sort of, you know, depression. No, no, no, what I mean by that is that, um you’re talking about the kids I went to school? I think you mentioned something… No, what I mentioned before, when I came back from Spain because I've had such a good childhood *gets interrupted* I wasn’t talking about you, you mentioned that someone, some kids that you went to school with, they came from really good families, but they were still on some sort of antidepressant medications. No, what I said before was they didn't come from such a good supported background. Ah, okay. Um, they're the ones that kind of tended to find an escape route from a for a different household unit, outside of the household. Now what I just, the last point is that I do know that there's, no, I have to say, no, no miscalculate that, it was, it come from, worse, now you’re making me think, ‘cause I’m tryna think ‘is there anyone I know?’ *taps his fingers on a surface* Don't worry? No, no, no, it's, it wasn't… Oh, don't worry about that one. Thank you. Is there anything else you want to add to box one or do you want to *gets interrupted* No, that's, the first one’s done, now, the second one is another experience of loneliness and I've definitely experienced this before and anyone that has kind of been in a relationship has experienced this before, so especially sounds, definitely had a connection with someone is that um I'm just gonna read it, I mean you can read it like a book. Basically, when you break up with someone, so what I was saying is that everybody from all points of life can experience loneliness, but what particularly stands out to me is the type of loneliness one experiences after a breakup, where you go from one extreme to the next, you go from knowing everything about this person to com-, completely not knowing what this person is doing or whatever and then it's like the whole talking every day, every night, and then not talking at all, it's just complete cut off, so but that obviously that's it, that's an experience of loneliness, in my opinion. Um, some people handle breakups better than others, I think I've had one bad one, I think I've made a girl have a bad experience of a breakup. So yeah, I mean, that's one, that's definitely a form of loneliness in my opinion. Um… but yeah, so, it's a weird, I mean it, because I feel like you need break up, some, some people need breakups to then level up themselves that sometimes when you’re stuck with one person is not actually good, um but I mean, yeah, I mean that's just my, my, my opinion is only one opinion and everyone's got on, so. Um, loneliness from love. Um, so you're saying that breakups make you feel lonely? Yeah, well, I think it might make me, yeah, definitely, of course when someone breaks up with you, it's a form of rejection, like I don't want to be with you no more, I did want to be with you, it was alright, but now I don't, see you later. Obviously, boys can be horrible, but I think girls can be horrible about things, but I'm not so much talking about the heartbreak and how they've broken up, I'm talking about the aftermath of ‘right chapter closed, shit what do I do now?’ Everyone has that thought when they break up, huh, ‘What do I do now? Do I try and win the person back? Do I got and get a new girlfriend? Do I go and get a new boyfriend? You know what I mean? So, yeah, definitely a form of loneliness, because sometimes I feel like when you get into a serious relationship as well, you can sorta kind of, all the time you were having with your friends prior to that relationship, then gets sucked up by this relationship, so, then you may not be talking to your mates as much, you don't particularly want your mates to know that you might not be having such a good time for a certain relationship. That's if you really like the girl, but if you're in a different situation where you actually actively telling your mates about your relationship and what is going downhill, then I think, going back to support systems, that is one way of maybe avoiding that loneliness after a breakup. So, all determines how you carry yourself during the relationship. Mmmh, yeah, that’ definitely. So, tell me more about like the feelings that you experience after your breakup, so obviously breakups make you feel lonely… Uuh, the word lonely, but to be fair after a break-up, sometimes you need to be alone. So, but it's just, it's the, it's the, it's the days after when people ask you ‘oh, how are you doing? How are you doing?’, you go ‘yeah, yeah, I’m alright, I’m alright, I’m alright’, and then your phone goes off and you look at the phone to see if it's that person and it's not that person. So, I don't know how you describe that feeling, maybe anticipation, anticipating that they text you, even though you've broken up with them and you know, they're not going to text you, because you don't want to seem like the weak to count upon to text them. So it's tennis in a battle within yourself, right? So, then you've got to kinda go through the whole ‘right do I bite the bullets? Swallow my pride and try and get them back? No, you can't be doing that, you can't be doing that.’ So, well me as a person I would not be doing that, some people would label that as toxic masculinity, but listen, I need to level up after that stuff, that means my next girlfriend needs to be nicer, better looking, mom needs to love her more than the last one. So, then again it kind of brings some kind of feelings of determination as well, but sometimes you could get over it, some people do things better than others me particularly after a breakup I do have to go on a kind of mad bender for two weeks, not, not for two weeks, but I have to be out maybe Friday, Saturday and Sunday, obviously still going home at the end of the night. But yeah to keep myself distracted from that thought of loneliness, do you know what I mean? Um, but the genuine feelings that you feel aren't very nice at tall; um, if you're not a crier, you're definitely gonna maybe get angry *laughs* and maybe take it out on other people like yeah, people that are close to you as well. So, it's not a good, it's not a good feeling, I sometimes feel like um *pause* relationships are good when they start, it really gives a nice start when they, when they kinda turns, when they fizzle out that's when the problems arise, especially when you're young as well and especially in the age of social media, so many distractions, as well. I've had countless no, not countless I’d say, with only one in particular, actually, she was n-, I don’t know why actually, she got jealous of you liking another girls’ pictures on Instagram, but they might not have been other particular girls that you actually know, but they might have been just models and stuff like that. I think that's a yeah, I think we're going off topic now, but… Good question, um so you’re mentioning social media, tell me more about that. Does that, tell me more about how does that relate to loneliness? *goes away for a minute* Uh, I’m back, I’m back, I’m back. The question was how do you think social media affects… No, no, no, the question was, because you mentioned something around social media, right? I wondered if you could tell me more about that, please. Meeh, the way it affects relationships? Or social media as a whole? Uh, sort of you mentioning that social media like, if you like a girl's profile. Yeah, that would depend on the girl, though, like there was one girl that I've been, she, yeah it used to annoy her, I used to get into arguments about it, I used to think it was stupid because ‘okay, if you go like some famous actors’ picture on loose top off on Instagram like, so what these girls wear bikinis all the time, that’s how they got all the likes, but then I went out with another girl, but she wasn’t not really, particularly too bothered by it. So, I think it all depends on the person, but I think social media as a whole is, um it takes people's attention, it grabs people's attention. So, like particularly in a relationship, if you have been hitting it off really well for six months, at that stage neither of you is really looking at your phones and you’re with each other, but once that passes and then you start to notice that one of you uses your phone more than the other, someone's obviously getting bored here and now social media is there to, to, to, to fill in that void with the boredom, as opposed to if you didn't have it there you'd have to think of some shit to do together. Excuse my language, but that's it, that's what I'm trying to get at, because I mean you can, some people li-, I like social media, I'm on Twitter and Instagram, so um I do see the funny side of it, but I feel like some people do get too, a bit too consumed because, and there's been studies, isn’t it? They’re about um like gives you a dopamine rush posting a picture and getting all them likes. And if you're not getting a dopamine rush from anywhere else, and you’re only getting it from social media that's gonna hook onto you like a, like a, like a fisherman's hook. I don't care what you're saying, if you’re getting a dopamine rush from elsewhere then maybe not so much, but if you're not, if you're only getting it from social media, that's when it's going to take over and it's going to start affecting stuff like social, like relationships the way you, I think view people as a whole, because you're constantly filling your brain with um, a simulation and then when you walk out your door, you don't see that because of all in your phone, because I know I can look at all pictures in there laying in Malibu and all stuff like that, as soon as I walk outside my door, there’s a concrete, like it’s concrete everywhere, no sunny beaches, no palm trees and it rains in the summer *laughs*. So I think sometimes social media can delude people, but it's all about mind over, mind over matter. Mmh, social media can delude people, they, it can take time from them, in the real world, being aware of their surroundings and so on. I think, it may have even deluded me at a point, when I was younger, yeah, yeah, but there you go mind over matter, you only make sure you’re getting um, make sure you're using social media, social media is not using you. My thing is also do you know what? Going back to that, the relationships point is so easy now, like aside from the liking model pictures and stuff like that, it's so easy now for me to just talk to a random stranger that I don't know, and then actually if I, if the conversation bangs off and I get to know them and then we actually meet up and it all kicks off, so like, it doesn't kick off but you have a like good finding there, whereas outside this social media world you can’t do that with stranger, you'd have to see that stranger in the street and talk to them face-to-face. And then again, if you see a stranger in the street and talk to them face-to-face, it might be different to them looking at your Instagram profile because everyone's Instagram profile looks boujee, everyone's *laughs* you don't want to post a shit picture, do ya? Hmm, but yeah, I think that's, yeah, that's me on the social media front. Thank you. Um… okay, you want to add anything else? Not to that second point, no, I mean, yeah, the main point of that was the loneliness one can experience after a breakup and it all depends on the person as to how they get along with that, but just no with the loneliness after a breakup, it does always kind of tend to get better, so, it's not the end of the world if you’re feeling lonely after a breakup and yeah. And with the social media one, when you go on social media, how does that make you feel? Me personally? I mean, I like it, it makes me laugh. I think social media, um… see now. Let's look at it in two different ways: so, you've got the adult population that will tend to watch the news in the morning, right? And then you’ve got the younger half of the population which tends to look at their phones first thing in the morning, right, maybe adults as well, but I think what, if you look at an adult social media feed compared to a young person’s social media feed, two very different things. Like for one, I know there's things that I see on my social media feed which don't get shown on the news, which should be on the news in my opinion. So, um… so yeah, it all just depends on, on what you choose to look at on your social media feed. It all, it’s really and truly down to the person, you do create your own reality and it's, that, that is exactly the same with your, your experience on social media, you create your YouTube, so you follow and stuff like that, but me particularly I, I use it more as an entertainment tool, but when I'm not getting any messages on my social media, I'm not really looking at it, but then there's other days when I'm talking to like 3-4 different people and I'm on it for maybe like, you know, I know, this is the other night because I was sitting there on my phone and I was watching, I was meant to be watching something on the telly as well, I missed 45 minutes of it, I was like ‘that really 45 minutes?’ so I rewind it, watched it all the way back, next minute is quarter to 1:00 in the morning, so a massive time-waster. But yeah, if you're not wasting your time doing that, well, you're going to be doing something else, but I just think, it's a bit far-fetched. I mean ugh, I’ve got so many different opinions on this subject, it’s unreal *laughs*. Yeah, like, I think is good, also I think is bad because it get, does get, the hold, the hold of people, especially young women, like young women's insecurities’ levels, I’m pretty sure they've risen since the 90s, pretty sure, they definitely have most, definitely have risen, especially now you get all these girls walking around, all these lip-fillers, they don't even look nice, only looks nice, on, behind a picture, behind the camera, camera lens. But yeah, I mean um, *silence* uuh, put it this way, if they took social media away tomorrow, I wouldn't be as bothered as most people. I get on with my life, I think I'll be a bit happy about it, ‘like yeah, here you go’, ‘cause I know *laughs* I've met people of a social media and yeah, you know what? Like I said before their page looks good and stuff like that and then you meet them and they're like, I’m like man you’re getting all this recognition when you're like this in person. I don't know. Maybe they're tired of constantly being glued to their phone and then when they are not glued to it, they don't want to say anything, do they. But yeah, that is one thing I've experienced in my lifetime, especially girls as well, you get girls with all them followers. I think, you know what yeah, there's one girl that I've been out with who, she didn't initially have a half a million followers, but she has got half a million followers now and she's the only one I'd say it's that kind of down to Earth, but she's a bit of a weirdo anyway, so she's bound to be, but then aside from that, all the, all the glamour one looking ones, their personalities are ugh so dead. Like dead to the point where, you get so worked up over their profiles, and then they just completely shoot your balloon out of the air, when you actually meet them and talk to them, so yeah, don't um, don't believe the hype with social media, definitely do not believe the hype and I think social media is just like drugs *laughs* for some people, so yeah, some people get hooked on it, some people can do it once and just leave it. Mmm. Okay, thank you. Um, you want to say anything else or do you want to move on? The last kind of extreme form of loneliness I thought of which I think is quite, everyone will kind of think of it, is OAPs in this country [OPS referring to Old Age Pensioner – a person who is old enough to receive an old age pension from the government].Particularly people that kind of got old and decided not to have kids and stuff like that, once everyone dies, they’re, they’re kind of left on their own, I don't think there's much help from the government to OAPs, I know that the BBC want to, um they want to scrap the free TV licence for OAPs. So, then that's another hindrance for them especially if they’ve got no one there for them, ‘cause I know if I like listen, my nan is quite fit and healthy, actually quite young as well, but I know if she got old and she was struggling, we would be there for her, you know what I mean? Financially, emotionally, in any way, shape or form. But if you haven't got that then, oh boy, I think personally I mean this might be a bit far-fetched and you've only just made me look like this in the interview, but if that was me as an RPP, I would not feel no way about committing suicide. I'm sorry, but what I’ve got to live for. Go on, have one last night getting completely plastered and take God knows what, you might go out with a bang, there you go, well, there you go, someone decides to do that, they might go out and decide that they're gonna get so out of their nuts that they're not gonna wake up, and they might make them a really good friend and then that will stuff  them, but obviously that's just like storybook material, but that's the last one. I think RRPs suffer more loneliness than anyone can believe, and than anyone else experiences in their young life, especially someone, kind of, compare loneliness from a breakup compared to someone that's been lonely for the last 7, 8 years. So, you're saying that you know not having any family or relatives or anyone with you as you're growing up or when you're older… No when you're older, people that don't have kids and stuff like that. And you know what? I'm kind of, I was, I remember like maybe two years ago, I was like ‘no, never having kids’, but you know what gotta have kids man, come on, why not? You can't just have one, you gotta have to as well. It was a bit selfish, I think. So, you're saying that if you have kids that actually helps prevent from loneliness. Oh, absolutely, have you ever seen them guys that like really big matcho man, like love going out and having fights and that in the minute they have a kid, they turn all soft. So they, it does something to you, it definitely does something to you, so yeah, that's definitely if you want to put loneliness on a spectrum, having kids is the complete opposite of loneliness, in my opinion. Definitely man. Come on, you’re not being selfish whatsoever, are you? Okay, um do you want to add anything else? No, nothing. You mentioned something about TV license? Yeah, that's just going on at the minute, because I think if you're lonely and alone, you got no financial support, you've only got, I don’t know, whatever it is their pension, they get, remember back in the day wages weren't as good as they are now, so their pensions has probably a bit diminished compared to what ours will be like, even though the inflation rates going to be through the roof, that’s a, that's aside from the point. But the BBC are a big massive corporation, why they're not giving the old people TV for free? What, what’s the reasoning behind it, what good is coming from, apart from you maybe getting a few people that want to watch telly, you're going to pay for their TV license, but I can tell you, there is so many people that just won't bother, there is no good coming from it, there's no good coming from charging people for their TV licence, something that's been free for a very long time for RRPs. Why are you going to shift up their lives now when they’re towards the end of it *laughs*, I wouldn't appreciate that. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't appreciate it the same, either. But yeah. Oh, yeah, and also look, if haven't got the TV to watch, maybe that's their, that's their escape from loneliness. You haven't got TV, then read books, dusty books they’ve got on their bookshelves that they might not even be able to reach. Mmh, so yeah, there you go. So, watching something on telly can actually help prevent loneliness? Uuh *blows* to a certain degree. I wouldn’t say, I would say, I think um… yeah, it might prevent it but might numb it, like, I think there's a few old ladies that might be able to relate to Graham Norton or judge Rinder. And if that, if that, if that, if that went, then they have to find a new hobby and I don't think old people have the capacity to do that, some people do, some people don't, it’s all down to the person. Mmh… all good? Do you want to say anything else? I’m gonna cancel this. Interview 4 – Male, 24, Newham - part 2 Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee So, can we start by talking about what you’ve put first please? Right, so the first thing that sprung to mind was a pub, only because I feel like pub culture is a dying culture, particularly in East London, and that my, uhh I can remember, I think one of my earliest memories, I can remember sitting on a pool table in a pub just rolling the balls around, because my dad loves the pub, he loves the pub, my dad is the type person you can go out in the city of London, and he will take you to a different pub each time and tell you a different story about it. So, growing up in pubs, obviously, if I go into a pub now that I'm old enough people probably know my dad, know my family, definitely know me, they’ve known me since I was a little kid, so the social connectedness there is like I don’t know, it’s like being in another home. Humm, obviously everything in moderation, I don't love pubs though my dad does, I just appreciate them. And you know, if you are feeling quite lonely you might go down to the pub, I guarantee someone will have you laughing or there’s someone to laugh at, at the pub and umm, if you're laughing at someone or with someone, you're probably doing it not on your own, you're probably doing it with someone else, so that's one place and then um one big place I said. Actually, you know what? I'm going to change this one *draws a line on it*, I'll put shopping centre, like a mall, as one, but I actually think now that I've read that again, I think a shopping centre is possibly, maybe a place, where you would be, where you would feel lonely because you've got so many people there that you don't know. Like, that's not socially connected whatsoever, it's not, it's just people browsing and purchasing things without having any, without having any real human interaction because you're out shopping, you're putting on a... facade, like when you go shopping with your mom or if you've ever been shopping with your mum and your mom will see someone and say something *laughs*, this may be a social connection between you two, but that's not socially connection between anyone else. But yeah, I've just changed that one, but let's go back to... Before going to the next one, I wondered, ‘cause you mentioned that going to a pub, you know, the laughter and things make you quickly feel more socially connected. Oh, absolutely, because laughter is the best medicine. So, umm, particularly with pubs, people are there to kind of forget, you don't bring your problems into a pup, I mean, there's some people I could go with maybe down for a drink and they might be upset from a breakup per se, he needs to sit down and drink something, but once you've all mopped and you’ve made him listen to all other stuff, he's going to be ‘all right, c’mon, pick yourself up, c’mon let’s go and get the other rounding, look, there’s some girls over there, let's go and have a chat to them’ and then all of a sudden, a certain girl tells you that she likes your smile, she likes your teeth and then you’re happy again, so, yeah, that's the social connection that can come from there and it springs out of nowhere in pubs as well, I think maybe it is to do with the Dutch courage from people having one or two pints, people are a bit more, they're more open minded, aren't they? More open to social interaction as well, whereas if you try to speak to someone on the commute to work in the morning, nobody's trying to talk to you. Um, so yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, pubs, pubs are good man, pubs are good and I don't think you can have a proper pub without a pub drunk in there, like you always have to have that one guy that is always in there, always drinking because otherwise, I mean to me that's what I can call a traditional pub. Um, but yes, aside from pups , I’ve then put parks, because right let me go to the park, there might be someone that you just know from playing football, not particularly your friend or anything like that, like an associate, like an acquaintance that you know, just from kinds of parks, just like the gym as well, there’s people that I know in the gym that I can have really kind of good deep conversations with, but I would never, I wouldn't tend to come out with me or anything like that. So, um so yeah, um then obviously, I've got my own home and friends’ houses, like I said, I come from quite a connected family, at home, so yeah, very big sort of connection, I think if someone, if you was a fly on the wall, you'd say we were a mad family because we’re quite open, we can say whatever we like, not um with, with, with limitations obviously like take that with a pinch of salt ‘we can say whatever we like’, like my mom doesn't sh-, shy away from any type of conversation we want to have with her, particularly, yeah, like my dad not so much, like my dad, you can't really, like my dad, yeah, he’s quite open-minded, yeah, but there's things that I wouldn't talk to my dad about and then I would talk to my mum about. But, apart from them, quite a very open, very open family. Do you feel like being open to a family member can actually get you more socially connected? Yes, because you need to have someone that actually, generally, knows how you are, you can't, you can't hide away from your mum and dad, c’mon they get, they get, your mom gave birth to you, like you can't, like, I mean, ugh I think everyone does this, like every teenager growing up, you don’t want, you don’t want your mum to know what you're actually up to until, everything, until like something bad happens and then like she finds out *laughs* so she’s gonna find out anyway, but I think being more open, definitely gives you a sense of, I don’t know, it gives you like a sense of satisfaction, man. I mean you can get satisfaction from lying to someone and knowing that you've got away with it, but it's a different sort of satisfaction, it's like the difference between dopamine and serotonin, dopamine is an instant gratification, serotonin is like long, long, for the long haul type of thing, so I think being honest enough with your parents, you get more satisfaction in the long run, because yeah, you might be one person one day, but as you get older and you get past that stage, you're going to understand why mum and dad have done and said certain things. Thank you, what about in the other box, you mentioned… Yeah, in the other box I said shopping centre. So, that's, this is, it's not very socially connected, I think, it’s more socially connected for younger people because I think with a lot of Americanization and a lot of American TV that young kids have been watching over here, everything surrounded in the mall, in the mall, all the kids go to the mall, ah, he kissed her in the mall. So yeah, I think now for younger kids, for the younger generation, maybe is a place where they feel more socially connected, but I think as you get older and those people that you do kind of chill with when your 13, 14, 15, 16 years old and then when you get older, when you’re 18, 19, you'll only see one or two of them. So, then yeah, then you can go back to that place where you felt so socially connected and you don't feel socially connected at all. So, that's why at first it was in, it was in a socially connected place, but now I’ve put it in most lonely because now if I go to the shopping centre, I won’t talk to anyone, no, I just want to get my shit, I wanna get my shopping and I want to go. Thank you. Okay, is there anything else you want to say? No, no, no."
