"Participant 15 – Female, 24, Hackney Part 1 Interviewer: OK. Can we talk about one what you put first? Respondent: In the first box I wrote the word anxious. Um…I don’t know why I wrote the word anxious, but in terms of the experience of loneliness, I think from my point of view, I actually suffer from anxiety. So, I know that in my actual anxious moments that's when I feel the most sort of lonely because even though I know other people suffer from anxiety no one suffers from it the way I do and I don't suffer from it the same way someone else does. So, no one would ever understand it the way that I do in terms of what anxiety is to me. Um… I: Yeah R: So that's why I wrote that. In the second box… I: Before we move on to the second one.... R: Ok. (Laugh) I: And how does that make you feel people not understanding your anxiety? R: Um…Sort of what I wrote in the third box actually, which was lost. But it's because there's no one to sort of, there, so, there is, there are people that you can speak to about the anxiety but in terms of actually understanding what triggers me or what triggers like the emotion there's not a problem or from my understanding there's no way that someone else could understand that. Except for me. And even still I'm still trying to figure it out. So how can someone else understand something I haven't fully understood myself? Yeah. I: How do you feel about that? R: What?  They're not understanding it? Or me not understanding it? I: Maybe we can start by you and then move on to the next. R: Oh yeah, so me, um…Kind of confused, because, it's me. How do you not understand yourself when you're the only person that's ever with yourself 24/7? No one should know me better than I do, but obviously with that, like, sort of, don't like the word condition but with the condition, it is sort of the trying to get to understand yourself in order to, sort of work with yourself to not get anxious. Yeah. So, it's a bit of a weird one and that's why kind of confusing. I: So, you say that you're trying to work with yourself to… R: To like, to better understand myself. I’m quite a confusing person [laughing]. I: And tell me about others. You said others don't understand your anxiety neither. R: Yeah. Because I like, I can't understand, say like my friend's anxiety because I don't live their life and I don't know their triggers. And even in a conversation I could tell them my like, what triggers me and they could tell me what triggers them but I would never actually understand this sort of feeling of being in that moment when the trigger is happening. And understanding why that makes them anxious, or the same for the, they might not understand why my triggers make me anxious. I: But how does that make you feel people not relating to you or understanding you? R: Um…Half irritated and half like, okay, because I can't expect everyone to understand me. But then at the same time it's irritating because why can't everyone understand me. But that's why it's sort of half and half, because I understand that I couldn't understand everyone else either. So, it's one of those sort of loops. Yeah, you get stuck in a circle. I: And so you put anxiety in the first box. R: Yes. I: And anxiety you believed kind of causes or kind of has is associated with loneliness for you. R: Yes. I: Tell me more about that. R: Anxiety being loneliness cause…I don’t know, anxiety can’t, it’s not shared. It is shared, people share their anxiety or their, they speak about it or speak on it but the actual feeling or the…  I'll say the fears that come with it are personal. So… Would say understanding it, like so, because they are so personal, no matter what you do share, it's not whole. Does that make any sense? It probably really doesn't. But, if, I don't know how to explain it just the actual being in in the anxiety is lonely. The working on it, the, the... I don’t know how to explain it. It is the feeling that is lonely, the actual feeling of anxiety is lonely because no matter how much you explain it or live it. You can set like, you can do things and then be like that's anxiety and people go okay but like, why didn't you do like this? Why didn't your reaction being something else? Like you can be anxious? But why was your reaction this? And I can't tell you why my reaction is that so it's a lonely feeling because it's not it's not easy to express. I: So if, so you're saying that because it's not easy to express your anxiety to others, that makes you feel lonely. R: Yeah. Because it's that. It's only me. Like. How do I elaborate? Because it's only. I don’t know. Yeah that just being me situation is the lonely part because no one else is going to “Oh, your anxiety looks like this, my anxiety is exactly the same. It's not for anyone. I: How do you know? R: Not never met someone else know my anxiety but in certain, because I've never met someone else with the same sort of, the same effects or the same, yeah the same effects. I: Tell me more about the effects? R: What? Of anxiety? Don’t know, it’s… I don’t know, sometimes I explain it like, it's more, it's a lot of things. So like in the moment, it could feel that claustrophobia, is not claustrophobia because you're not locked in a little room with four walls feeling like you're closed in that it can feel like you're closed in and you can feel like, your blood is literally boiling or something. Obviously, it's no boiling you are not on fire. Yeah. It’s like. Don’t know. It's confusing… That's what makes it sort of lonely. Because you can't. You can't like. It's not physical. You can't grasp on to, or make it understood or, easily I don't know easily explain it. And so it makes the individual going through it feel like they're the only one that is going through it. Obviously, I'm not. But in that moment when it takes over, it's just you. So, because it's just you know like, no one else, I don't know. It feels like no one else is there. I: How does that make you feel? R: Anxious. I try to think of another word than lonely because obviously is just that. But… Lost for words. I: You said it makes you feel anxious. R: Yes. I: Tell me more about that. R: That, closed, like, bit like antagonistic. That's what my, my anxious is, like fit in, and in physically look for what it's like. Um… I don’t know. I: How does that affect your loneliness. R: I think makes a bit deeper like a bit more, like stronger, loneliness. So, because you believe no one understands, you stop trying to make people understand. So, it's like “oh they're not going to get it. So I just won't explain it.” And that sort of like closes doors, and stuff like that, But not wholly, because it's like you close doors of yourself, not of like living, is that make any sense? Say you still go out and about do everything normal. But parts of yourself get closed off. I: So you're saying that sometimes you feel that people don't understand you, don't understand what you're going through. And because of that, you just don't express or you don't, you just shut it. R: Yeah. I: You go back to do your everyday stuff. How do you feel about that? R: Sort of get like, robotic, not robotic but robotic. So, only some people see the whole individual or the whole me but while you're out about, back at your job or I’ve just finished my degree, so, when I was doing my degree and all of that, that would be like ‘Oh, sort of scheduled’, and that you know that at this time you do this and that time, within that like, when you sort of talk to people or anything like that it's like there's only a few things that you do with that sort of thing and it's all based around slack work or school sort of thing. And that's where this sort of robotic nurse comes into it. Because it is a routine. I: How does that impact your loneliness. R: It makes it more obvious to you, say like, after a while, you go like… After a while, it is sort of like, something, I don’t know how to explain it, I do know how to explain it, but that some of the words, maybe not the right word so it becomes an act. I use the work act because that's what I did. I acted. I'm a performer arts person. But it becomes like that. So it becomes like a performance. So you’re a character, to some, but you are the actress to others. If that makes any sense? I: Tell me more about that. R: What mean? Just two beings or multiple beings? Um, t's weird because when you're learning about acting, in each of your characters you bring a bit of you to them but it's like, it's like the starting point in something of you and then you build on you to make the character. So, every accident in real life every person that you meet in your act gets a little bit of you but not the whole you. But then people that you meet and they know about what you go through like the anxiousness and how you feel outside of your performance or everyday life they sort of half and half understand it. So, people, I don't want to like, confuse it. But people within the performance always think that the performance is your reality. And people in your reality wonder why your reality is not your performance. Does that make sense? I don't know. I: I’m trying to understand. Tell me more about it. R: So, I don’t know how to. So let’s say people in the reality, like be like your family, your actual true friends, like people that know you within your, that come to your house, let's say that those type of people know you in your reality, so, they see you at your lows and your highs. Whereas the people in your performance only see you in your highs, so they think you're always happy and always bubbly and always like, that person so, you're always that character and then so and then the people in your reality that have seen your lows and stuff, wonder why is it that home at home or like, in real life you can be that down. But the moment you step outside you are always happy and always this and always that. And then it becomes a sort of the loneliness in that comes out in the whole like, people that actually know you sort of take it as a, not offensively or anything but it does come off as ‘oh, you are not never happy around them but why you’re never happy around them, that sort of thing. But it's not that, it's just I don't have the, I don't expect others so, the audience in my fake reality, so performance, they don't have to understand the actress, like they don't have to, they're there for the performance. They're there for the character. So, people at work and outside, whereas the people at home you'd expect them to be able to handle the loneliness and they might not always and so that's why they sort of, going back to them going ‘why are you always why you always’, and then it becomes a ‘I've not always but I'm’… Don’t know how to explain it. Hope I am not confusing you yet. I: No, I am actually fine. You are doing really well. R: I don’t know. Yeah. So, because they don't understand why you can be down in front of them and they take it offensively that makes you feel lonely because after a while you're like, it's like a burden you feel like a burden. So, going into feeling like a burden, you don't want to keep being that. And that sets off more closures within yourself. So you you're less likely to reach out to them and that makes you lonely as well. Because they half closed off from you and you close off from them. And that's your, that's now your real world shut off to everything that was real. So, you're living in this sort of like, performance forever. And no one in the performance knows you. So that’s lonely, because you can't open up to anyone properly and then you are shut off from the people that you won’t be able to reach out to when you're in that low state. And so you're just sort of left with no one. Yeah. Suddenly feels lonely. I: So it sounds like what you're saying is that in the real world you have your highs and lows and people end up because of your lows, people you feel like you might be a burden to them. R: Yeah. I: Tell me more about the real world. R: What do you mean? I: Tell me more about your highs and lows. R: I don't really know much about my highs or lows. That's sort of the issue. I don't know. I suppose, it depends. But no one's ever just happy or just sad, so it is a bit of like a roller coaster. You never know what you're going to be in the hour or the minute or the day. So, it usually just depends. Like, do I have a plan for the day, or am I just gonna be home watching TV or something. And that, sort of, that sort of lets us know what kind of day it's going to be. Or even going into work because I work in retail at the moment. So going into work, have they got enough people on shift? Is, am I at tills or am I at fitting room? All those sorts of I don't know what it's going to be like in terms of my highs and lows. I: So, when you said that you might be a burden to others. Can you tell me more about that? R: Because of like the way I work or my mind works or… They don't always understand or I'm I'm not that good at explaining. And so, it becomes sort of tiring to others or I think I can come off as tiring to others? I: Tell me more about that? R: Um I don't know I just think I'm a really weird person. And like, my weirdness isn’t very understood and so that in itself can be like that, I know you, and so that becomes a burden, like. I don’t know. Like I wouldn't say, I'm trying to think of a good way to explain it. You're not the…I use my cat, it's like my cat. You live, because we're different species, I can't just go “Hunter, what do you want?” And even if I did say “Hunter what you want?” he might be out back at me and I still don't really know what you want. So, he'll follow you around sort of thing and you have to figure it out because I'm not good at explaining, I'm kind of like speaking in cat. And so that is sort of the end. That would be the burden because you're forever trying to figure out what's going on with me and so… I don’t know, it's just hard. I: So, it sounds like because you think that your anxiety and things, as you said like maybe your weirdness may be a burden to others, at then results to you feeling lonely. R: Yeah. Because, either side, so me or the other party would end up closing ourselves off to one or the other. It's like me to them, or them to me, because we can't figure out the understanding of what's going on.  It just sort of leaves you alone but not necessarily physically alone. Just like mentally alone. Once you get into your own head is, that's enough to make yourself lonely, because you might not be lonely in general that you might be in the room full of people. And the moment you overthink or, yeah, it is over thinking, you get into your own head, you get sort of, I don’t know. Like you lose, not you but like the actual understanding of what's going on. Yeah. I: Mentioned, thank you by the way. You mentioned that you might be in a room full of people. Can you tell me more about that? R: Um, so. You've been so like being in a room full of people but you’d be the only person with whatever is on your mind on your mind. Yeah, that's lonely because they can't understand it, not because, they've tried, but because it's not out there like it's not in the open for others to try and understand or be able to try to understand. So, whatever your feeling is within yourself, is lonely because it's not a feeling shared, stays only to yourself. So that is the sort of loneliness of it all. But is also that feeling of like… I wouldn't say trapped but not trapped, so I will roll with trapped. If it makes sense. Like, that in my head… a lion in a cage popped up in a circus. Don't know why. But you're the lion in the cage and you've got a crowd of people around you. You're fighting to get out, but everyone's like “oh! Entertainment in the cage.”, like they don't understand what your fight is. They just see it as, it's like two views of the same thing. The lion is trying to get out and in the lion’s mind he is trapped. This isn't a good place. It's not fun. He doesn't understand the lights and the crowds and everything else that's going on around him, it is danger. But to everyone else from their perspective is entertainment. They're there. They enjoying popcorn, they’re like “Oh! Clowns, Chaplin DU DU DU DU DU” it is two different scenarios in the one. And that's why it's like being in a room of crowds of people and not being or not quite having the same view or opinion or whatever. Yeah, I'm sorry about all of these crazy exclamations. I: No, I think they are really good by the way. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. So it sounds like what you're saying is you could be in a room with full of people and they may not understand you. So, while you physically with a lot of people, mentally you could feel alone. R: Yeah. You explained it so well. I: No, this is the thing you said. R: Yeah. I: So tell me more about that mental loneliness. R: It’s hard because it might just be your understanding of what's going on, that, or, just the way you understand on them. The because of every single individual goes through in terms of the same, both like their nature and nurture. So to me, my nature is a mixed white black British who lives in Hackney. No wait that’s the nature. Yeah. And then it goes into the nurture, which is I live in Hackney. I've grown up in this area all my life. So, for me, my understanding of the world would be very different to like, yours. I don't know where you're from or where you live but we could be in a room full of people like me or you, could be in a room full of people like me and we all understand each other or what's going on. And then you wouldn't understand it because you haven't grown up in the same way we have. But take that to like, instead of you just physically being your being is like the way you think. And so everyone around you sort of thinks the same, acts the same. And you're in the middle. Being that one sort of that anomaly. I don’t know if that make sense. I: It does makes sense. And how does that make you feel? R: Um. Not always the greatest because it's not easy and I know nothing is easy. But like, trying to sort of like make yourself understood or like, yeah, heard, understood seen, like, it is hard I don't know. I just went around in a circle there. Yeah it's like a feeling of being lost in plain view. Yeah. And even that doesn't really make sense. Yeah, it's that, knowing there's nothing wrong. But you are not going to lie. But it is. Yeah, but it’s only wrong because it doesn't quite fit in. I: Okay, is anything else you want to say about that box. R: Not really. I: Sure. Can we talk about what you put in the second box? R: The second box kind was the same, because it was actually an individual in a group of people. Which is kind of what I just said. So I don’t know. I: Let me ask you this then in relation to that one. You said that, you know the problem is well, you said that ‘fitting in’. Can you tell me more about that? R: So, from my personal experiences, I don’t know, it is hard to fit in but it's not because, I don’t know. It's the being different sort of thing. So, I'm not average anything, is that making any common sense? The average height for a female is between 5 5 and 5 7, I am 6 1 and a half. I'm plus size in the world that accepts standard course size which is now, I don't know, but it's not me. So, it's sort of one of those things where being like me, in a room full of people who are all the average, even though it makes me stand out, it makes me feel lonely because no one else can sort of get it. Or it’s not, I don’t want to say the word correct because it's is correct because you can't copy a wrong human. But it's like being, like being a puzzle piece that doesn't fit. So, everyone is a puzzle piece, you're just from a different package. Yeah. I don't know. I: Thank you. Makes sense. Tell me, how does that make you feel when you feel like you're in a room where you don’t feel that you're like the average. Let’s say you talked about your weight, you talked about your height. How does that make you feel being in a room with others who you feel you’re not an average like them? R: I don't want to say annoyed because it doesn't make me annoyed. What is, what, in that situation, would be the annoying part is the opinions that they set onto me because of the physical, before getting to know me, the sort of thing. So, I've had a lot of things where people go “oh, before I actually spoke to you, I thought you were like sort of threatening or you came off as threatening or whatever.” And that's just because of the physical. And then they speak to me and then ‘oh, you're actually quite nice, you know’. So that would be the annoying part but it's the fact that they feel like that. That sort of sets it, not sets it off, but that's kind of how I was gonna finish my sentence. Yeah. Set it off. Oh yeah. I don't know. I; No,no. It does make sense. Thank you. Thank you. And the fact that people can judge you before they speak to you. R: Yeah. I: How do you feel about that? R: A bit like saddened, I suppose, because I wouldn't do that to someone else. But I don’t know. I meet someone and that person that they present themselves to be, instead of I see someone of their own you look like. If that makes any kind of sense. I: Yeah. R: So because I don't sort of make judgments or I try not to. Because I'm sure I've made judgments in my lifetime but I try not to because of all of my life experiences. So, my dad has no left hand. So, if I saw someone with a disability I'm not going to think that person has no left hand, they're not a nice person. I don't know. That doesn't really, it doesn't correlate, but yeah. So, I wouldn't see someone that looks like me and think “oh they are a bad person” because I don't know.  I've been introduced to all types and all sorts. If that makes sense. I'm actually knowing myself I'm not that bad. So, like for someone else to see me and think the worst first, yes, it’s kind of saddening. Because I always give someone a chance. Even if they ended up being a bad person. Like every bad person has some kind of good in them. We don't know. I: Is there anything you want to say about that? R: No. I: Okay. Do you want to talk about what you put next? R: In the third box, I put lost. Um…. This sort of feeling or, yeah the feeling of loneliness feels lost. I don’t know. It’s that sort of not knowing feeling, and the… How to explain lost? It is lonely. Yeah, sorry. I don't know how to explain it. I: No problem. R: You said not knowing, not knowing what? I: About what's next or even handling what's now. So, if I explain it, for when I finished at uni, I felt lost because, well I felt lost because I'd been in education all my life that I started nursery at 3 and I finished up and I’m about to be 25.So that's my whole life. Basically, that I've been in education. And while you're in that sort of system you know that you'll get set homework or you'll get set like assessments or you go to uni on this timetable or school or whatever. At this timetable you have everything set out, you know what you're doing from the day to day. And once that ends and you go into your career, it's the finding your job and finding what's going on. So, you never really know what exactly is next. And so you feel lost in that moment. So it is. Yeah. Other people are obviously going through it but they're all at different stages of that ending. So, for us it would be like getting your agent and get in a role in like a production or something. So out of the 14 of us that were in my actual class we were all at different points, so some people had agents, some people had agents and jobs, some people didn't have agents at all and were still looking for representation, so it was lonely in that sense because none of the 14 of us were at the same stage, at the same time. So you didn't know whether you were going to leave with your degree and with a job or with at least someone that would help you find jobs or maybe you were just leaving with just your degree and maybe you didn't want to go into anything to do with the performing arts industry and so you were just taking it onto like graduate jobs and seemingly completely leaving the industry. And so you were lost in the sense that, what was next? Because if it's not to do with everything you've just studied for then how do I transfer those skills and how do I… Yeah, do all of that. So it's a bit, it makes you lost lonely, because you sit there over-thinking about each step. Yeah. I: And how does that make you feel? R: A bit, I would say confused. Yeah, because there's always someone to ask in that situation, but it's only for so long because as soon as you leave, you don't have like your whole faculty to run to be like “You did it. How do I do it.” So, I studied at Manchester. I’ve come back to London. I can't call up my old teachers or go back into my old school or do stuff like that and get those sorts of answers. I'm now in a totally different city doing it by myself and there's not that many people that would understand how to set yourself up in my industry, so like my mom can’t do it. Because she studied English and journalism which is what my sister is studying. So they could talk to each other, but I can’t talk to them because they wouldn't understand my career. Just like I didn't understand theirs because I really didn't like English, it’s my harder subject. Yeah, I don’t know. I: Yeah. Um okay, so it sounds like what you're saying is… Sounds like, you're saying that you've just finished school and you've always been used to going to school and now you know you're at a different phase in your life. So, because you don't know what is next, you feel a bit lost and that leads to feeling lonely. R: Yeah. But that. I don't know. It does, but it's also the trying to make yourself understand that is, it is that phase. And once you sort of. Until you understand that is lonely, because the loneliness the sort of, lessens with the understanding of this is just a moment or this is just a blip or is a pause sort of thing. It could take you. I: It’s good. Thank you. Do you want to say anything else about that? R: No. I: OK, no problem. Do you want to talk about what did you put in your final box? R: So, it is a picture. And it was over-thinking or the other, now that I look at it, it looks like a sad clown. It was just like a person over-thinking or having too many thoughts. That’s lonely because when you do get to the point of overthinking, you are trying to make each thought like a bullet point. If that makes any sense. And it's like trying to get, trying to process it or you don't know how or who and what you can do or turn to in order to do so. And so you don't, it’s like how can you walk up to a person and say “oh I've got all of these like situations and I'm trying to figure it out” without them sort of turning around going ‘but they are your situations, go figure it out’, sort of thing. So, it gets it gets lonely in the sense that you, yourself have to sit there and like get through them… Yeah, because it is a handful and that sort of goes back to the burden thing because it is like… I can’t offer lots onto one person, because now that person has all of my thoughts or over thoughts. And that's not fair because if I couldn't handle them, how are they going to handle them. Well yeah, so then you try and not to offload and then you sort of, they pile up and you get snowed under, sort of thing. And so, it's like lonely being in the figuring-out stage. I: So it sounds like you have all these thoughts or problems or worries in your head, or your reality. But you feel like you can't share it with other people, or tell them about your problems because you feel that it would be a burden on them. And so they pile up in you and then they have an impact on you. R: Yeah, yeah. So, they sort of… You experienced the loneliness in the sense, in the not sharing. Sorry. Yeah because you don't share them. It might be anything. Like it could be, I need to get the bus or something. So, I know that I'll leave my house, go down to the escalator, I mean like the stairs in the elevator thing. And I can go down the stairs and go in the lift or climb the fence or walk down and go through the sort of gateway. But in doing all of that, a bus could be coming in one minute or a bus could be coming in 20 minutes, so, do I, do all of that rush I get the one minute one, and how do I do it? What's the quickest way to do it? Or, do I take my time, wait for the 20 minute one but then how do I plan, like? This isn't a normal thought but how do I plan to get downstairs for the 20 minute one in enough time that I actually do catch it. Or, do I end up leaving in 20 minutes and then get to the bus stop just in time, but the bus is pulling out. Not a normal overthinking worry of mine. I've never thought about that in my life. Because buses public come frequently you know. But if that is an overthinking thing in my head, I wouldn't know how to share that, because even just saying it now that sounds so stupid. If there's a bus coming in one minute and a bus coming in 20 minutes, I'll leave in 15 minutes and wait five minutes at the bus stop. And that just makes sense. But I don’t know, it is like… sitting there over thinking of the things that are so… They seem trivial to other people but to the individual might be like a really, really big and so, because to the individual it’s quite big that the individual thinks that, is trivial to others, you'll keep it to yourself. And so, kind of inadvertently make yourself lonely, just because you over-thought it that much, that when you got to the point of ‘oh, maybe I should share this’, is like “Oh, it's black, it's big to me, but it's probably really stupid to others’ and so you don't. But, I think a lot. So I don't, I don't know. Just, so you just get to that point where it's like, I don’t know. Yeah, you just kind of, you feel silly and so because you feel silly, it's like… I don’t know. Sorry. It just makes no sense. I just waffled. I: All makes perfect sense. Thank you. How does that make you feel thinking that you know, you think, you may think a lot about things and then you may think that other people would assume that this might be stupid like you said, how does that make you feel? R: Sort of closed off. But it's like a… Closed off because it is… It is not silly but it is silly, if that make sense, it really doesn't. In a… Well, I can imagine being in a, like a… oh, what’s the word? Marketing? NO. Is that marketing? No. Or call centres, you know when everyone's talking at once sort of thing and you can't, because it's so loud you can't figure out a way to process a thought or process, or get it to come out, which is this. Say you don't, because it's so, because all the thoughts are going at once, you can't get one out straight or you can't make it make sense. So, you just don't. Because everything that does come out ends up being a bit of a jumble. And so others can’t understand that jumble. You might try once or twice, once you kind of get that no one understands that you just stop trying cause like what’s the point? You can't make yourself understood with the overthinking and so you just, you just don't try. Or, they stop listening, because there's only so many ways you can say lack of sentence. So, yeah, I don't know that bit didn't really make sense. But yeah. I: So, it sounds like. You're saying that because you have so many thoughts going through your head. It might make it difficult for you to try to clarify or articulate a thought to others and so others, and so others may kind of lose patience or may kind of not understand you or understand what you're trying to say and that can make you closed off and result in feeling, making you feel lonely. R: Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. I: And how do you feel about it? R: A bit half and half, it’s like half and half of what?… It could be a sort of ‘ah, why they not listening or why are they not understanding?’ but okay. It didn't really make sense and so. I don't really… Not care. But, It's not okay, sort of thing. It isn't the feeling but it annoys, I think, if it makes sense. Yeah it's just one of those things that, do, is it important enough to get out, sort of thoughts, or can I handle just sort of letting them keep going around in my own head without saying them out loud and as much as you sometimes can just go: Okay. I'll just keep that in my head. That doesn't always help because it's just still not a on process through. So, you might get out one that makes a bit space but then like, you keep another that still takes out space and then you take on another, because you thought you made space because of the one you removed. That's just knock back at the same point again. You still got two thoughts at the end of the day, even those three that happened. I: Thank you. Is there anything else you want to add to the recording? No. That was really good. Participant 15 – Part 2, Female, 24, Hackney R: Considered that, changing to Android but I don't wanna learn Androids, because I feel once you have an iPhone, that you sort of get used to that, everything is about iPhone. I: Yeah I know. Thank you. OK, can we talk about what you put first? R: Um.. In both, I put the reservoir but in the socially connected one I also put the balcony. So, socially connected, the reservoir because, it's just a really nice place. So we have like, when myself and my sister wanted to talk something, and we don't want to do it in the House, we will go there. Or, me and my friends said, me and anyone that just wants to have like a chit chat and sit and taken a view sort of thing, because it's really pretty, we'll go there, we'll talk, it's nice, it's got like a play park and stuff like this. Yeah, you could be sociable there and the balcony also so not just outside, like, oh yeah, just outside there, because it's where your neighbors are, so that just stand there and talk and you can see everything that's going on and that, this is the house that I was born into. So I've known people that have lived in this area always, and so you sort of know that next door is this person downstairs is that person or they have a history attached to them. So, my, mine and my sister's first ever babysit, lives on the other block directly across from us. Um, there's two little girls whose hair I usually do downstairs and stuff like this, but their big brother was in the same year group as my little sister at the same time, so, yeah, I don’t know,  it's just, yeah, I feel socially connect to it like that way.  Um… Yeah. I dont know. Because everything has a bit of a story. I: You know thats great. And please can you tell me more about the first one you put, I can't pronounce the reservoir. R: Reservior. I: What is that? R: So, just across and back there is like Thames water, water,  if I speak properly and they, I don't know, clean the water? So, that's what comes through our taps. But recently with the sort of new builds that they've done, they've made it look really nice, because they're sort of in this area, they did quite a few little plots of like what I call gentrification bits, so they're just changing up the bit, so people are moving out but new people are moving in that can afford all of these new places, but where it's really nice. But it has to be really nice for them to make so much offer for them. Going into that area that and just sit in, like is, I don't know how to explain, it's just water. So you just sit there and you can see just water and like the city centre light in the distance, so you can see that Canary Wharf and stuff like that. Which you can see from our balcony up there as well, which is also why I like our balcony, but I don't know, it's just a lot more going on in the reservoir. So, you've got the community centre, which used to be across there, so from our balcony you can see that the old Redmond centre and that is also nice in terms of community, because that too has like memories of things that we've done in the community but now we have the new one. You've got both things like: workshops and libraries and stuff that us as a community can go over a day or… I don’t know, like say um. Just be, like Yeah, I dont know. I: What does it make you feel when you at resevior? R: See, that’s why  is an half and half. Which is why it's also my lonely place because it's my thinking spot or part of it is my thinking spot because it's quite a little lengthy bit, you go from the park and then go up and there's like a little pathway, we have benches and stuff on it. So,  maybe this went train of thought. Yeah. Why is also my lonely spot is because like, when I do need to, say from the other task when I do get into the points of like anxious or overthinking or like feeling lost or something. I go there as well. And so it's sort of like a, it's sort of like a limbo, where you're in-between place where you can figure things out or sort of leave them there and leave them unsolved if they just if you realize they're unnecessary like thoughts or something. Yeah. I've done quite a bit of thinking there. It's, but it's like the spot at different times of the day as well, so it becomes like my… But it is the both at the different times of the day and so on. So yeah the day is very much community based, so you see everyone kids, everyone parents, the elderly walking, and stuff like that. But then at night time, it's really silent and so, when you going there to think it's easier because there's not all of that noise. There's not the buzz of the dual carriageway of 7th systems right sort of thing but then when you go there like say with other people. So, when me and my sister go there it's the sorting out of the noise of whatever's going on around us, sort of thing. So, we can talk about what's gone on during our day today or what's annoyed us between ourselves because obviously sisters are sisters, so we can let, figure ourselves out or talk how… Like, just life. I don't know how to explain it. It's just a place that to sort yourself out. I: You said it’s a lonely place because when you're there, thoughts are in your head. R: Yeah. But I go there to intentionally be lonely. Or intentionally be alone, which is slightly different. But some like, I don't think loneliness is always a negative. So, you might feel deep loneliness where you are craving to be around other people. And so, that loneliness is like I'm alone but I don’t want to be. And then sometimes you seek out loneliness because being around other people doesn't allow yourself to figure out everything you need to figure out. And so you take yourself away from business. And that's the positive loneliness sort of thing. Yeah. So when I go there and it is like, it is to intentionally be lonely it's to have that peace to figure out everything that's going on. Within, like is that some people can like put on YouTube and be vegetation or you can stay outside will do the same thing that guided or not guided, it's just two different versions of the same thing. Yeah. I: How does it feel when you there? R: So peaceful. Yeah, because you can do more. And there's not… As not the leads the... I'll go back to that the last thing in the boxes, in Box 1 and I was talking about the character and the actress sort of thing. When you're in that spot, you don't have to be either. You could just be. And that's why I said it's like a limbo, because yourself and the area of the in-between. I don't know it's like being in a church and looking for sanctuary. That, is that peace that you're looking for, you're not looking for… It’s like a get in the way. I: So, you're saying that you're there. You don't have to act up. Or, you have to be somebody or, you can just be... R: Me. I: . Tell me more, tell me more about that. R: I don't know. You don't have to be anything. And that's what I mean. Like it's a space where that has no fixed intention for it, not for the space, say like we're in the living room, or in the living room you do things like sit and talk to your family or we have our dining table in it, so that you dinner and stuff like this. But out there, it could be anything. So I I'll give you examples, I went there when my cousin passed and I went there to study lions for auditions and I've been there to just talk to friends or like, get away from the feeling of being anxious. So, you just sit there and breathe through that. It can be a place where anything can happen and it doesn't have like a… There, obviously there's a play park, so that has the intention of children playing or there's benches, so you sit that sort of thing or you lay down. You know what, like anything. But it's not, It's not I have to. You don't have to sit there and play in the park. You don't have to sit on the bench. You can walk. You can look at it. It could be anything and so. If it could be anything it can be everything, that makes any kind of sense. I: Does make it. Is there anything else you want to say? Mentioned the patio that you bump into people that you know, you grew up there, you do some girl's hair downstairs. R: Yeah. I: You know a lot of people. Tell me more about that. R: It is like… By the council is described as the communal area. And so it kind of does just that, like it brings the community sort of together in that area. So, just standing there. You can, I don’t know, you become a part of the community. So I can stand up my doorway and see my neighbor who I said was my babysitter when I was little, her mom still lives there. So I'll see her mother every day when she walks out and we could just wave at each other and say hello or downstairs of the actual like, in the actual car park. That's where all of us as kids used to play. So, we play football or ride our bikes and stuff like that. And everyone around would know whose kid was whose and sort of thing. So, you’d always have someone watching out for you, they'd always be like, I don't know, aunties and uncles that aren't your actual aunties and uncles, or grab words that aren't your actual grandmothers, granddads, they are not the actual grandmas and granddads. So that we had the granddad that everyone called granddad. He was no one's granddad but he'd always come down and fix our backs. That, I don't know. So, you just sort of become, I don't know, more community, become family. So everyone, not everyone knows your, what's going on in your lives or anything like that. But everyone sets out to sort of have your back. I don't know. Yeah I remember explaining it to someone that was younger than me. So, at one point my auntie moved into this block. She's moved out now. But she lived on the first floor. And my cousin and the girl across, how does… She have a son. So, they were friends and they got into a fight and myself and the girl across. She was the sister of my old babysitter, so I got together and explained to both of them that is no point you fighting each other, because in our community, where we'd always have to have each other's backs. So even if your mom wasn't around, you'd be able to knock on my door and say oh I need xxx. Or, like can you help me with or can I, I've locked myself out, can I stay in your living room until my mom gets home sort of thing. So we, I don't know, it was children being children, but we explained to them that it is a community it is a family and so everyone is there for you. And it sort it feels like when you are just out on the balcony you can just talk to everyone or see someone who knows you from when he was little or anything like that. Or even, or even like the labor around the corner. He stopped me the other day and was like “Oh! Casey, how are you? xxxx. Ah, you've grown up so much.” Because obviously I went to UNI. I'm OK but he's like “Oh you've grown up so much.” I was like “yeah I'm in my 20s now.” sort of things that are people remembers you when you were this small. And for someone to be able to say that to you, like I don't know. Not that it… I don't know, it's a sort of warming that oh you've known me since I was that small sort of thing. Not that many people can say that to me but people in this community can. Yeah I don't know. It's just nice. I: Thank you. Good thank you. Is there anything else you want to say. R: No. I: OK."
