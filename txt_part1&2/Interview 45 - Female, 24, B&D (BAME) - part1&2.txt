"Interview 45 - Female, 24, B&D Can we start by talking about what you put in box 1 please? So the first one is basically what I said is being by yourself for example I feel like loneliness comes with a lot of things but being by yourself not being around the right people causes loneliness like for example when I was in uni I was on my own constantly on my own it was just going to uni and coming back home in a way i was kind of like socially awkward if that's the word so I found myself being lonely a lot of the times I have nothing to do, I know I have no friends around me no family around me so I was constantly lonely. The only thing that i was doing was work and uni, that's literally it so I put it in the first box thing by yourself being by yourself. Being by yourself causes loneliness cause being around the right people you won't feel as lonely as being on your own so that's the first one I put for the first box and the second box I put… Before we move on to the second one, I’m going to go a bit deeper into each box, asking questions and so on.  Okay. So when you said you weren’t around the right people, can you tell me more about that? Like for example when I was in uni I was I was around people but just not around the right people i was just around people for going out I have like my party people when I wanna go out they’re there but when I'm going through my own stress when I need someone around me like like to talk things to, they were not there so I found myself being lonely a lot of the times because the right people were not around me and also I didn't really mingle or find the right people to mingle with so I found myself being lonely a lot of the times and it gets to the point whereby i got used to it it's just i became a loner if that's the word in a way and i feel like being lonely as well kind of helped me to think about life in general so i don't see loneliness as something that is a bad thing in a way yeah So sounds like what you're saying is when you're ready university when you experienced some stress whatever you felt like you couldn't connect with people…  no because I haven't because I have a habit of when I'm stressed I tend to move away from people i kind of like distance my way from people because I put myself in certain boxes whereby I prefer being lonely, it makes me kind of like, think outside the box and make me see things different ways of then people being around me constantly, so in a way I do prefer being lonely I love being lonely if that's the word. So and also like you said that if you wanted to party you had friends but if you wanted to to if you felt lonely and if you yeah like if you had friends to party if you wanted to put you had the right people but then if you wanted to, to you know have people to kind of…  I have serious discussions with I have conversations with they were not there because everyone, i don't know how to put it, my mum always says putting yourself around certain people can either make you think and actually grow up or, or is that right what I'm trying to say? Like being around the right people can that either push you to achieve greatness or or go to the road whereby you go out party or do the other things in uni like everyone does so I wasn’t putting myself around the right people so I found myself being lonely a lot of the times because I wasn't involved with the right people that was there for them to talk to me or have a conversation with me, they were not there, do you know what I mean? Yeah. And how did that make you feel?  it made me feel lonely, it got to the point where I was depressed for a bit. I was seeing a counsellor, someone to talk to you because I was lonely and being lonely kind of makes you become very antisocial and just all you do is think think think think think so I was seeing someone outside of uni like to help me, I’d talk my problems to and then they’d give me advice which was really helpful. So sounds like you don't feel like you have the right people around you when you were at uni. No. Having the right people around you is very important because you know if not, you find yourself being lonely just stressed, depressed, you name it.  So what you're saying is there were people that wanted to party and stuff, you could go out and party with them but you couldn't actually connect with them at a deeper level.  no, no, no. But then I feel like everyone has those kinds of people in their life. You have people that you party with you have people that you have a deeper conversation with.   And when you said that sometimes loneliness can be good for you, can you tell me more about that? Yeah. The reason why I said that is cause when you're lonely, when you're on your own like I said to you before your brain kind of like go outside the box you see things in a bigger picture, you see things differently than when someone is constantly around you you see it their way. Do you get what I'm trying to say to you? Where by, if you're on your own, you can sit down and think and actually structure think in your head and actually try to achieve things much quicker and better when you're on your own if that makes sense than having people around you because you can have like 6 people around you and you won't go far compared to when you're on your own, when you're lonely in your room on your own, you're thinking, you are what's the word you're planning on your life, you're actually working towards your goals and objectives in life, do you know what I'm trying to say to you? So being lonely in a way it's not a bad thing it's a good thing in a way because you, it expands your brain, you see things differently.  Yeah, so sounds like loneliness has a positive aspect to it.  It is, it is, it's not just negative because I feel like some people see it as a bad thing cos nowadays’ generation, we don't like being on our own, you want to be in the crowd like to feel be longing for you to feel like you're part of a society that you're not and some people see it as being on your own as a big issue as a like you're a weirdo if that makes sense, like they put a label on you because you want to be on your own you know what I'm trying to say? And it's not a bad thing to me, I prefer being on my own more than anything because it gets you out of trouble, it doesn't, being on your own doesn't really make you get into trouble, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? like you’re just doing you, do you know what I mean?  When you say loneliness gets you out of trouble, can you tell me more about that? For example, if you’re like someone that goes out all the time, you’re most likely to get into trouble with people, you're most likely to get in to start doing something that you're not meant to be doing, do you know what I’m saying? Whereby, when you're lonely you're on your own you see things differently, you think, do you understand, the percentages of you getting to trouble is more lower, the risk is more lower compared to when you are out there if that makes sense. I don't know if I'm making sense yeah so. Yeah. When you say trouble, you’re less likely to get into trouble, what do you mean by trouble? Well I don't know my kind of, I'll give you an example, like my kind of  friends are the friends that wanna go out, wanna do this, wanna do that, and anytime I go out with them, i end up, I always get into trouble either finding myself doing something that I shouldn't be doing, for example, either smoking and or drinking, drinking to the point where I'm not able to control it then I start doing things i'm not really should be doing, i'm not meant to be doing, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? Whereby if you're lonely, on your own, you're not, it's impossible for you to get into trouble only if you are like that as a person do you get what I'm saying to you but being lonely is a good thing to be honest even though some people see it as a bad thing as you're just a weirdo being on your own, it's not a bad thing, I feel like it's a good thing it's like 50/40. Mmm. You mentioned that nowadays, today's generation people don't want to be on their own, can you tell me more about that? I feel like people are scared to be on their own. At one point of time when I was growing up when I was back in college and stuff,  i was scared to be on my own because i see it as being on my own i feel like an outsider, do you understand what I'm trying to say? When you're on your own people don't tend to pay attention to you, do you understand what I'm saying? I'm the kind of person I like seeking attention so I want to be in the loudest group i want to be with the coolest person do you get what I'm saying to you and yeah so, people see it as a bad thing I don't know, they see it as a bad thing, I don't feel like it's a bad thing, I feel like it's a good thing because being on your own like I said to you it's good because you tend to see things differently and you tend to think, there's nothing wrong with that, it's just that nowadays generations people just see this as a bad thing because everyone wants to fit in, everyone wants to feel like when you're walking in a room the attention should be on you and it shouldn’t be really (....10:34-10:36), do you get what I'm trying to say to you?  When you say, like people want to fit in, can you tell me more about that? When I mean fit in I was like people want to be in the coolest group you understand what I'm saying they want to be the centre of attention like fit in can be you're doing things because someone else is doing it, it, it's not you but you're doing it just to fit in, to feel part of a to feel belonging or feel a part of a group, do you get what i'm trying to say to you? like for example you might how can I say you might like what's the word drinking I don't like drinking but because I'm around you I might feel pressured to feel like I should drink for me to feel some type of belonging to feel part of the group, people do things that they shouldn't do but just so that they can fit in and feel belonging so that someone can accept them for who they are when actually don't accept you for who you are you are becoming someone else that you should really become if that makes sense So sounds like what you're saying is nowadays people don't want to be alone because they they they want to be included yeah  yeah but then I feel like as well because it's not even people don't want to I feel like because everyone has that aspects of life whereby you go out, you are out there but when you go to your room that's when things would hit you, you get what I'm saying that's when things hit you when you go to your room I feel like everyone has that what's the word you have that time of life when you're lonely, do you get what I’m trying to say to you and everyone goes through different things, you go out there, you feel belonged but then when you go to your room you're lonely do you understand what I'm saying? People go out there, keep a smile on their face but deep inside they're lonely.  How do you feel about that? Me personally? You mean like me? I feel like it's something that you have to learn and you have to, like, accept. I feel like nowadays teenagers what we young people are scared to, because when you're lonely you come up with ideas, I feel like some people are just scared to break out their idea or to talk to someone because they feel like they call them names or feel like people will start kind of pointing fingers at them or looking at them differently.  When you say looking at them differently, can you tell me more about that?  Like a weirdo. Like, I don't know how to explain it, it's just I don't know how to explain it, people just look at you like a weirdo because you're different like everyone wants everyone to be the same and you being different becomes a problem so everyone just try to blend in or call you, people will call you weirdos so instead of someone going through, you getting bullied they tend to just fit in then, do you understand what I’m saying? I don’t know if I'm making sense but… Yeah, you’re, thank you. How does that make you feel let's say for example when people think of you or look at you differently? It makes me feel some type of way cause when I was in school I was that type of girl that would just stay in my little corner and before I opened my mouth I would think you have to think and it just makes you feel some type of way, and it pressures to become something you're not because someone that is lonely is not hard to spot, do you understand what I'm saying? I can see someone walking just from their body language or their personality or the way they carry themselves. You can tell they are lonely. Do you understand what I'm saying but I feel like the way the generation is nowadays man it's so much bullies out there, everyone has to feel some type of way, everyone has to dress some type of way for you to feel belonging or for you to feel like you're part of their little group.  So it sounds like what you're saying is, people do things that they don’t necessarily want to do just so that they can fit in.  Yeah yeah, it’s out there,  it's everywhere man, it's everywhere, you go anywhere now, that's how the world is becoming, that's how the world has become. The world is like that already, do you get what I mean? It's like that already. You can't be yourself, being yourself is an issue, it's a problem so you'll have to become something else. Social media or whatever create, people create it so you have to you have to become that, you can't be can't be you, being you is like, very very difficult being you, for being you can become a problem, it's like a big issue to someone because they either don't like you the way you are or they just see you as someone that is boring, do you know what I mean? When you say it’s something that's boring or it’s an issue to be yourself can you tell me more about that?  Say that again sorry. When you said like it's an issue to be yourself can you tell me more about that? Yeah, like how can I explain, give an example? Like being yourself, like me around my friends and around, when I'm with my parents I'm a different person, when I'm around my friends I'm a totally different person because around my parents I can be myself I can actually be me I can be what I want to do do you understand what I'm saying and I know if I do this or that that’s going to take me there in life or that's going to make me do this but then when I'm around my friends I'm a totally different person like a totally different person. I'm loud, i'm rude, I smoke, you understand what I'm saying? I'm a totally different person. It's not necessary because i want to do and I know I have the choice of doing it but it's just so that I can feel, feel part of it because I've been bullied before when I was in school do you understand what I'm saying? I've been bullied before because of the way I look, the way I dress, the way I talk, do you understand what i'm saying? I've been bullied, so now that I have reached, I'm 24 years old now do you understand what I'm saying? Now that i've reached a certain age, I’ve kind of like blend in and kind of like adapt to the way my friends want me to be, it's not a good thing my mum always tell me about that it's not a good thing but that's just how now generation is compared to my parents generation, my parents generation, they can be who they want to be, do you understand what I'm saying? They be themselves sitting down thinking, it's not a problem, but here now sitting down, if, like, for example, I like sitting on my own sometimes, it's not because I'm crazy but I just like sitting on my own when you sit on your own you think, you see things differently. If I sit on my own for too long people ask me ‘what's wrong? Are you alright what's going on?’ There's nothing wrong with sitting, like, sometimes I say to them, there's nothing wrong with me sitting on my own it doesn't mean i'm depressed, it doesn't mean I'm lonely, it's just so that I can sit down and actually think about life, do you understand what I'm saying to you? But now generation, people don't really take the time to actually see things like that or sit down and think, do you understand what I'm saying? That's why everyone is just, you can see nowadays girls who all dress the same, who all look the same because everyone is trying to be either like a celebrity or whatever they’re bringing out there. Everyone wants to fit in, everyone wants to be part of it, you get what I'm trying to say to you? Like, you know, yeah.  How does that make you feel? Before it used to upset me but now it's part of life do you understand what I'm saying to you it's part of life it's just how, here, here it is, in my country back home it's different, so different, so different back home, like my mum's country is so different, here is just how society is like.  You mentioned when you were in university you felt like a loner, can you tell me more about that? When I was in uni I was always alone, I was always alone, especially in 3rd year 3rd  year was when i kind of felt like proper lonely i was proper depressed 3rd year, because you're on your own, all the friends you started within the first year either dropped out or some of them don't come back and when you get to like second and third year, you kind of see life differently you kind of like focus, you see it as ‘ok you know what I need to bring myself away from that group’, so you find yourself being lonely most of the time, you're lonely most of the time because you take yourself out of certain situation, do you know what I mean so you find yourself being lonely most of the time in uni especially in uni, I feel like uni if you go for a uni you can be able to face whatever life brings to you because uni is when you go through different emotions -  first year is all about party, second year; it's about mmm, third year that’s when you actually sit down and you find yourself being lonely most of the times and in the 3d year, I found myself being lonely most of the time because I couldn't do what my friends were doing because I had to prioritise my life, i had to sit down and actually talk to myself like listen ‘everyone you started with, they're not even in the finish line, most of them drop out because they're basically going out’, so being lonely is ok it's not a bad thing it's only a moment of time so I found myself being lonely most of the time because I had no, I had, I did a thing whereby i took all my social media off like i took everything away - my laptop, my tv, I took everything away so that I can just sit down and actually focus and actually just do my dissertation and just finished with it so i did find myself lonely most of the times and to be honest you can't really tell someone how to kind of like overcome being lonely because it's just something that you find yourself doing especially if you want to achieve something in life. If you want to get somewhere in life you're going to be lonely, because that's the only time you can achieve something you want to do, do you get what I'm saying to you so yeah yeah. And when you said that you took yourself out of groups or social situations, can you tell me more?  Yeah, like, first year, I keep going back to uni because my that's my experience. First year, I was around certain people whereby ‘oh, we're going out’, they have a thing where they say first year don't count you go out I'll be going out 24/7 clubbing, partying, even if I don't have nothing to do I just go to a mate's house because I don't want to be on my own, do you understand what I'm saying so even if I've got nothing to do I would go to a friend's house and just sit there, I probably sit there for like the whole day, i have nothing to do but just so that I don't, I wasn't on my own and when that was happening I found myself that my grades were kind of like going down, my grades were looking bad I was getting C, D, and that's not that's not something that I wanted to get do you understand what I'm saying? So I had to make the decision where I had to take out all the negative people around me. It's a decision that I made because I wanted to finish uni, do you understand what I'm saying? I was going to uni to get a grade and come out, do you understand what I'm saying? I see uni as a (prison? - 22:27), you go to uni, do your time and come back out, do you understand what I'm saying? So I had to take myself off certain people, do you understand what i'm saying? And actually just be on my own and just do things my way instead of doing it someone else's way or doing it because someone says let's do this and I be like ok do you understand what I'm saying? Instead of being a follower I was a leader i don't want to be a follower anymore, do you understand what I'm saying? So I had to take myself off off those group of people if that makes sense, so yeah. You mentioned that you know you wrote here being by yourself you mentioned that, you know, if you wanted to party you had your friends but what I'm just trying to think what you said very early on, you felt like by yourself cuz if you wanted to party you had people to do that you had your party friends but then you didn’t necessarily, couldn't necessarily, yeah have deep… Deep thought, like to think about life? No I couldn't because when you're around people that when you're around people that love partying, all you talk about is partying, you don't talk about anything beneficial, you talk about going out or doing the most stupidest thing. Not one time did I actually sit down with my friends and actually talk about ‘ok guys let's study, let's do this, let's do that’, nothing productive, everything was just partying do you get what I mean like it was just nothing was beneficial to me it was just yeah let's go let's do this let's do that have the latest this have the latest that, you get what I'm saying to you, so. And when you said social media earlier, you mentioned that social media kind of plays into this.  Can you tell me more about that? Oh, social media plays a big part. What do you mean, like, fit in, like what do you mean? Yeah, because I think we were talking about the idea of fitting in and this and that, you said social media, you mentioned social media, you didn’t talk about it actually. I was wondering if you can tell me more about… I feel like social media is a big, big, big, big problem nowadays it's a massive problem. Social media, I can go on and on about it for time, social media is a big part that have this image the place where by everyone should be happy, everyone should be doing this, everyone should be dressing this way, everyone should be having this, having that, it's a big, it’s a big part in nowadays’ generation and I feel like our generation was so focused in social media that you don't have time to actually sit down and think, you don't, because social media is a massive it's a massive problem, when I was in uni I had to cut it off because I'd be sitting and I found myself going through my phone when I should be studying. It's a big distraction, it's a big, big distraction because it has this image, the place whereby everyone has to, have to have the car, the latest car, the fastest car, the latest is, the latest that, so you find, you see young people following celebrities and you see other people, you have different types of people, you have people that are loner; lonely people that like sitting down thinking, you have people that like mingling, people that like going out and because of the way social media is, how can I say? The way social media is, people have taken social media as a big thing, it makes certain people can't even, can't even sit down and think anymore because all you do is just think about, you’re just on your phone constantly, so I feel like it's a big, it's a big issue, it's a massive issue.  And, so, when you say it's an issue do you mean that it distracts you from your studies and stuff? It's a massive distraction. Like I said to you, when I was in uni, instead of me studying I was on my phone, on either instagram, facebook, snapchat, Twitter, you name it. Nowadays we don't sit down and think, we're just on social media, social media does everything for us it does everything for you, so. How does that make you feel? Doesn't make me feel any type of way to be honest. I feel like it's all about self discipline. If you can discipline yourself then it won't affect you, it doesn't really affect me to be honest, it doesn't affect me because you have to train yourself, you have to prioritise your time, you have time to go on social media, you have to actually, ‘ok you know what I need to do this, do that’, it doesn't really affect me to be honest, it's part of my life in a way because there's no odd day I wake up in the morning, don't go through my phone. First thing in the morning I am on my phone, last thing at night I'm on my phone, so it's part of life. What is it about social media that sort of attracts you to it? Communicating with people. You have different ways of communicating to different people. My aunts and uncles are in Africa, I still communicate with them through there, do you understand what I'm saying? I can reach people quicker and easier, I don't need to travel to talk to you. You just, you know, you can do so many things on social media. And also, I use it to make money as well sometimes, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? So, it's just how you see it as. Some people see social media as a bad thing but no I don't see it as a bad thing, it doesn't really affect me in life you know? It's part of my life. if I don't have my phone with me I'm sick. I literally, I'm literally sick the whole day. Anything happens to my phone I’m sick, it's part of life. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Huh? Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Because I know you mention it's a part of life… I think it's both, it's like 50/50 but that’s why I said it’s all about self-discipline. If you know you have something important to do I won’t sit on my phone. I'll go through my phone don't get me wrong but then I manage my time. It's all about self-discipline, if you discipline yourself then it won't affect you, like I said to you it doesn't really affect me it's a negative thing but it doesn't really affect me because I know how to manage my time, I know when I need to do something, my phone is off till when I finish doing it then my phone is back on. Any when you talked about this whole sort of trying to fit in and then you mentioned social media I wonder what you meant by bringing social media into it. Like for example, on, like if you go on instagram most of the girls and the guys you see most of the guys is either six pack, tattoos, you have to look a certain way, you have to dress a certain way, the females have to look a certain way, so people use social media to fit in. Me, personally, I go online to shop, I go online look at celebrities and I be like ‘ok I like what she's wearing or what he's wearing’, I won't be able to afford it but I can look for something similar in a way, do you get what I'm trying to say to you so in a way it plays, it plays a big word because teenagers nowadays are under pressure because you have to have the biggest bum, the smallest waist, do you understand what I'm saying to you? So, in a way it plays a big role. It pressures people to do certain things, to look a certain way for you to be accepted for or you to be called beautiful or for you to be like that person is handsome, you have to go through certain things. When you said you know, you know, teenagers feel under pressure, can you tell me more about that? Or young people. When I mean under pressure, it’s like, for example, my insecurity is my nose, that's my biggest insecurity. Every time I go on the internet, either a celebrity, one of my idols or a celebrity or something, someone that I look up to, done their nose, done their mouth, done a little surgery then and there, do you know what I mean? You feel pressured to, to do it because that's the only way someone can call you beautiful or that's the way you can feel like you are beautiful and I feel like sometimes us young people would not even want someone else to call us beautiful, it's just so that you can feel like you’re part of, you’re part of, what’s the word, you’re part of society, you're part of the team, you're part of whatever label they want to put on you, do you get what I mean, so. Sounds like, it can be a way to be accepted.  In a way yes that's the only way they can accept you because if you feel, if you, you do, if you do certain things that's the only way people can actually accept you for (who? - 31:59) you are. You have to go through certain things, you have to do certain things, you have to dress a certain way, you have to to put your makeup on certain way, you can't look natural cause you looking natural is a bad thing, you have to look all fake and stuff for them to accept you or for a guy to even look at you in the street, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? Depending on who you're trying to attract. How does that make you feel? It makes me feel s*** about myself. It makes me feel really bad about myself because everyone has their own insecurities, my insecurities kick in everyday I go out, every time I look at social media my insecurities kick in. I tried to put them in the back of my head but any time I open my phone and look at someone else, it kicks in, do you get what I mean? Because that's what the, that's the picture they gave out there, that's what they try to present out there, that's how females should look. So it's not, it’s not a good thing, that's something I'm going through at the moment, something I'm trying to mentally kind of like teach myself, mentally and physically, like for me to actually accept the way I look, do you get what I'm saying? Sounds like social media makes you feel inadequate? Huh? Sounds like social media makes you feel bad about yourself. It makes me feel bad, it makes me feel worse, it makes me feel really bad, that's one of my biggest problems right now. It makes me feel worse cause I feel like sometimes I’m too skinny because all the models or everyone that I look up to like for example Kar Debbie, Olden Lan [OR ‘all them lot’, some popular women on social media], they have a little bit of a curve and nowadays, guys only talk to girls if you have you know a little bit of bum, you get what I'm trying to say to you so it does put pressure on. I feel like most girls, most girls can actually say that. It's just I feel like you can't just blame social media as well because sometimes the guys as well - what they’re seeing, what they want? Do you get what I mean? So.Yeah. Sounds like the pressure be it from social media or be it from attractiveness or looking good in front of guys and… I don't feel like it's just for guys I feel like it's just in general, I feel like it’s social media - there's just so much pressure there. I feel like, I feel like it's just social media - the way they present things and the way they make things and that's how they make their money but girls like us don't really, wouldn't really see it, do you understand what I'm saying, like the celebrities that I would look up to, they have to look a certain way because that's how they make their money, do you understand what I'm saying and they have the money to, to, to do what they need to do. I feel like all the pleasure is coming from them and the only way we can access it is by seeing it through social media, that's the only way and I feel like social media is is one of the biggest problems in nowadays generation. How does it make you feel when you see for example celebrities having things or other girls having things that you may not necessarily, you may want to have but you don’t have? It makes me angry in life, it makes me go harder. What I mean it makes me go harder it makes me want to achieve things quicker, it makes me stay motivated, it makes me, it pushes me to actually, it drives me, I don't know what's the word I'm looking for but it drives me to achieve greatness. For example, if I see someone, you’re wearing that, I want it, i'm going to work hard for it, do you understand what I'm trying to say to you, that's like, that’s my motivation, it pushes me to actually achieve it. For example, like now, my mum and dad live in a place whereby, I don't, I don’t, it's not an area that I like, do you understand what I'm saying, I'm very, I want to start a family, I don't want to raise my kids in this area. What does it do? It makes me go to uni to achieve my, my degree. Now, I'm going to look for a job. If I want to do my masters, I’ll do my masters, it pushes me in a way, do you get what i'm trying to say? So, it's not all bad in a way, it depends how you see it as and who you are as a person. I'm the kind of person I don't want something from you, I want to work for it, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? It all depends on the person.  It sounds like you're, you’re, you’re driven by success. Yeah, very, I am. You have to man, in life. Nowadays generation, you have to. Someone is not going to give you money, you have to go out and get it and the only way you can take your family out of certain situations is by used actually stepping out, out of your comfort zone and actually going to get it, do you know what I mean? So, so. It also sounds like social media motivates you? It does. Like I said to you I make money through social media, most of the time I make money through it, most of the time I make money through it. I do my modelling on the side so in a way that's, that’s money for me, do you understand what I'm saying. I use it to kind of like, put myself out there to make money, so it's like 50/50, it's good and it's bad in a way.  So sounds like social media plays a good as well as bad role in your life.  Yeah, yeah it’s like, that's why I said it’s 50/50, you can either use it to achieve greatness or let it bring you down as a person, I use it for both because I will see someone with this, that, I want it, I go through social media and make money through it. There are so many ways you can use social media, you can either sit at home all depressed looking at someone else, do you understand what I'm saying or you can use the tools and social media and make money through it so it depends on you as a person, it all depends on you as the person. So, it sounds like what you're saying is, on the one hand, social media is good for you because it helps you to make money and helps you to be motivated but on the other hand seeing things or seeing things that other people have that you may not necessarily have can make you feel lonely, can make you feel jealous and sad about yourself. I wouldn't say jealous is the word I don't feel jealous. I feel like I don't think jealousy is the word. It’s just as a human you have that, you have that thing in you whereby you see something you want especially if you know you can get it, something you can get, like for example I see my dad went to uni, did his master's, I want to do the same thing, do you understand what I’m saying? It's not because I'm jealous, it's just so, so that I can be, be where he is as well, do you know what I'm trying to say to you? It's not, it’s not, I don't feel like it's jealousy, I feel that it’s just, I don't know what the word for it but it's not jealousy, I think it's just self-drive that's the word. It depends how you use it man, it depends on how you use it.  Is there anything else you want to say about box 1? No.  Can we talk about what you put in box two? OK, box two, I put not having the right people around you (family, friends). The reason why I said that, there was a period of time when I left my mum and dad's house and I wasn't talking to them for a certain reason and and I found myself lonely, I was so lonely not because not because what's the word I feel like it's because I missed them I found myself lonely and I didn't have the right people to kind of like direct me in the way I just left and then go, do you understand what I’m saying? I feel like having the right support system that's what I'm saying having the right support system around you will make someone not to become lonely because you go home and see your family even if you have a long day, your mindset is not strong but you go home and see your family that kind of like awake you, you kind of like, okay, do you understand what I'm saying, even if you feel lonely but having the right people around you is important. Family, family is very important, take out the friends but family is very important. So, it sounds like family can provide that support for you if you’ve had a bad day, if you're going through a difficulty. Even if you're not going through anything, seeing your family puts light on your face, makes you laugh, makes you happy. I’m a family person so family for me is very important. If my family is not around don’t talk to me cause I’m down, I'm lonely, I’m upset so having your family around you is very important and I feel like certain people become lonely to the point whereby they become depressed because loneliness can make you become depressed, can lead to depression so having your family around you is very important. You can have a family and don’t have friends, you’re still fine, so. Yeah. And, how did it make you feel when you left your friends and family for some time? Like I was really down, depressed, I didn’t wanna eat, i didn't wanna do anything, I didn’t have someone to talk to, you come home from work, there’s no one there, there's no food, no one to even annoy you, even your little sisters, you might think they’re annoying now but when I left, I missed them. I missed them when I left. Yeah, it’s very important, family.  And you mentioned that family is more important than friends.  Ofcourse. I would take family over any friends. Your family is there for you, is a blood, blood is thicker than water. You can piss off your family, that family member is always gonna be there, regardless of what. Friends can come and go, do you know what i’m trying to say to you, friends can come and go, family won't go, they’ll be pissed, they won’t be there in that moment of time but they’re forever your family you can’t change that, you can't change your family but you can change your friends so for me family is very important, family plays a great role in anyone’s life, massively whether they’re an annoying family or what or you don’t like them, but I’d choose family over any friend. Friends, they come and go, most of my friends, they come when they benefit something from you they’re gone, family they will stick, stick by you no matter what, they’ll be by you.  When you said that friends come and they benefit from you and then go, can you tell me more about that? I feel like people come to your life based on their needs, based on their needs people come to your life. I’ve been having friends whereby they come to me because they needed that support at that moment and I gave them that support but once they get that support, that’s it or once they get what they want, that’s it. For example, my friends I used to go out with, I don’t talk to them anymore, we don’t go out anywhere because that moment of time they were benefiting from me whereby I would go out, we’d go out together, they want my company so that moment in time they were benefiting from me and I was benefiting from them but now because I'm not doing the same thing I'm not needed anymore, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? I'm not going out with them anymore so I'm not needed anymore. Do you get what I’m trying to say to you? So, yeah man, friends come and go man. I feel like everything is a season. You have a season where someone will come to you, someone will come in your life and the season finishes they go, someone else comes, do you understand what I’m saying, that’s how life is, but whereby family, no matter what season it is they are there, do get what I’m trying to say to you, they are there. So yeah. And how does that make you feel when you know that you’re not needed by your friends? It gets me so angry, ughhh man, it gets me angry. Because you just use me, it gets me, aghh mate it gets me angry, you can’t do anything that’s how life is, you just have to be smart about things next time. You understand what I’m saying? Don’t make yourself too available to people.  So sounds like, the fact that your friends took advantage of you, just used you whenever they needed it, and now that you know you don’t associate with them in the same way… It’s not even that, I feel like what they did kind of like spoiled opportunity for other people because now they wanna, I don't even wanna chill with anyone, I'm fine with my family, do you understand what I’m saying, so what they did to me kind of made me learn and actually change my lifestyle in a way. You get what I'm trying to say, it makes me change my lifestyle because I don’t want  someone else to come to benefit from me and then go, I don't want that, so i’m not giving you the opportunity to even come into life. Do you get what I’m trying to say to you? They’re just ruining it for everyone else.  How do you feel about that?  It makes me angry because I'm the kind of person if I said I'm friends with you I'm riding for you, I take you like a sister or brother. Do you understand what I’m trying to say to you? So they did hurt me. It’s like yea, now, I don’t give someone else that opportunity, you wont come and hurt me cause i don’t open the door for you anymore, do you get what i’m trying to say to you? So in a way they kind of like spoiled it for everyone else and it makes me angry with myself because sometimes someone good will come into my life that just wanna, someone good but then automatically I think okay they just want to come and then use me and then go next, so it makes me angry, it makes me upset, I feel like that’s something I’m actually holding on to and I don’t think. It makes you become smarter, I see it as it makes you wiser in life. Sounds like you don’t want to get hurt.  No. No one, no one wants to get hurt no on in life wants to get hurt. It's not a good thing. Sounds like you've got hurt before. A lot of times. But it's cos you give people the opportunity to, you open the door for them, that's why. If the door is not open someone will not come. Like me, I won't come and hurt you because you haven't opened the door for me, do you get what I'm trying to say to you, so that's just how life is.  Sounds like you feel safer this way. Yeah I love being lonely now, there's nothing wrong with that man. I feel like young people, they're scared of it, there's nothing wrong with it, I love it now, it makes you mature, it makes you see life in a different angle where you never used to see that. How do you feel about that now that you can see life in a different way? I'm happier before I wasn't happy I act like I was happy but I wasn't happy. When I go into my room I'm crying, now I'm happier, I'm happier because I’ve accepted me for who I am and I've accepted my own company, I love my own company now, so. So when you said you accept yourself for who you are now, can you tell me more? Like now? I can stay on my own. Before I was scared of being on my own. I accept that I am a thinker, I am someone that thinks a lot, I’m a thinker, do you understand, I’ve accepted that there's nothing wrong with me because before now, I’d think a lot and people made me think like I'm a crazy person because I think a lot. I've learnt to accept it, there's nothing wrong with it, it's good to think, so. When you said that people made you think like you were crazy because you thought a lot about stuff, can you tell me more about that? I’m the kind of person, I think, how can I say it? Before I make a decision I think a lot and I like talking to people to get like their views before I make a decision. I think a lot, like a little thing would bother me but to someone who would see it as a bother to me because I’d be sitting down thinking about it, so to certain people it might be, it might be a problem but to me it’s not a problem anymore, I’ve accepted it, do you get what I mean? I've kind of like see it as, it’s not a bad thing, it’s nothing crazy, it’s good to sit down and talk to yourself, it’s good to sit down and actually think about things before you make a decision, but my friends before, would see me as ‘oh you think too much’, ‘oh you just making yourself depressed and lonely’. There’s nothing wrong with it, I had to, I had to learn that the hard way, do you understand what I’m saying? I had to learn that the hard way because I was so used to people being around me constantly and when I turned around there was someone, when I picked up my phone there is someone - always available. I had to kind of like take myself out of that and actually just accept myself and enjoy my own company. I feel like that’s one thing I never used to do, enjoy my own company, I used to hate sitting on my own. When you said you were scared to be on your own, can you tell me more about that? Because when I’m on my own, I think a lot so I was scared to kind of like think about things, when I'm on my own I think 24/7, I think about ok what am I going to do tomorrow, how am I going to help mum, how am I going to do this, how am I going to do that and I was scared of that because I didn't want to face reality but when I'm around people talking about something else my mind is somewhere else do you understand what I’m saying? So I was scared of sitting sitting alone, I want someone to be around me constantly even if it's a little kid as long as there's someone around me so I don't have to think or do you mean because I'm a thinker i'm a thinker and i'm scared of that, i'm a thinker and I'm scared of thinking sometimes because it's just scary I don't know, it's just scary and the way and it's not just friends, even family members that used to make me feel like it's something that's bad, made me even more scared of it But now I'm just, I feel like it's all about maturities, all about age, you go through certain things, certain age, and when you come off that you kind of like, the older you get the more wiser you become in a way. When you say that you were scared of thinking, thinking scares you, can you tell me more about that? What I mean like scared of thinking, like I don't know how to put it man, I'm a weirdo, I don't know how to put it I don't know how to say it man. Like I'll be thinking, like,  for example, when you do something to me and i'll just sit there and think about it all day, I'm like that and I'll think about how I have to overcome it and how not to do it next time, how to take a different approach or let's say for example if I fail an exam, how am I going to overcome that next time? What can I do differently? I'm like that, I don't know man, I'm a weirdo, my friends say I'm a weirdo. How does it make you feel? Before it used to upset me, but a weirdo, like I said, being a weirdo, there's nothing wrong with being a weirdo. Oh no how does it make you feel knowing that you don't like, you know, you engage in thinking that you don't necessarily like? I don't know, now it doesn't really bother me, now I take time to think. Before I used to be scared of it because I don't want to think about it i see it as it's making me depressed but it's not making me depressed it just makes me see things in a different angle. Before I used to be scared of that. I'm not going to lie to you before I'd never be in a room on my own for more than an hour, I'm looking for somewhere to go something to do because I don't want to sit down and think but now you think. I feel like when you think you'll come up with different ideas because I want to run my own business in maybe the next three or 4 years. Sometimes I sit down, do like a little map, little thing, just ideas, do you know what I mean? It's a weird thing for someone at 24 to do but that's what I love doing, I will sit down and you know. You know you mentioned earlier that you know, you covered your, like you weren't happy as in you pretended to be happy, can you tell me more about that?  Like what, around people? Like me pretending to be happy around people? Oh, Gosh. Did I understand that correctly?  Yeah. I'm the kind of person that I like smiling making sure everything is ok. I like what's the word I don't want someone to know what I'm going through that's that's (something, something - 54:38) saying. Like I can, now I can be going through the maddest thing but you never know, do you understand what I'm saying because i'll keep a happy face and I’m smiling, I don't want people to know my business that's the word so I pretend, I prefer to be, pretending to be happy when I'm not deep inside, or I don't want to bother you with my issues or my problems, do you get it? So yeah. When you say you don't want to, you don't want people to know that you're not happy, can you tell me more about that? Because I feel like, like me not wanting people to know cause I know, I have this thing yeah whereby if something is not going right in my life I sit down and cry and think about shit that I shouldn’t be thinking about sorry but what I feel like sometimes I put myself, my partner always says to me I put myself in a box, i like putting myself in a box whereby I'm all quiet and stuff but then that's cos I don't want someone, because how can I say it? It's like me coming to you telling you I'm going through this, going through, going through this, going through that, that moment of time you might listen to me but the next time you gonna use it against me and I don't want you to use that against me or i don't want you to, i don't want to be seen vulnerable to you, do you understand what i'm trying to say to you? So I tend to keep it in and just act like I am happy because I don't want someone to take advantage of me because you being vulnerable, you going through a situation, people can take advantage of you, you understand what I'm trying to say to you? I don't want that in life so I will act like i am happy outside, inside my room I am going through my own little demons but I can overcome it because it's all about your mindset, it’s all about your mind so you can wake up in the morning and look yourself in the mirror and say yourself you're beautiful or you can wake up in the morning and tell yourself you're ugly and the rest of your day is rubbish your day something, your mood is something (something? - 56:39-41). It’s all about your mindset. How would that make you feel if you make yourself vulnerable? It makes me, I can never make myself vulnerable. I've been through that and someone has taken advantage of me being vulnerable, I can never do that again, it just makes me, what’s the word, it makes me snappy if that's the word, it makes me snappy, it makes me take notice of everything around me, I can never be vulnerable, never. It's just because before I was being vulnerable, people take advantage of me, it just makes me stronger now, I'm not strong inside, inside I'm a baby, but, but my face, I’ll become strong, I pretended like I am strong but inside I'm dying, if that makes sense.  When you say ‘outside you pretend to be strong’, can you tell me more? Because I want everyone around me to be happy I don't want someone to be because if I explain my situation to you, you, your mood is going to be, you're either going to feel sorry for me or you're going to feel some type of way, I don't want you to go through that I don't want you to go through my stress or take medicine for my own headache i don't want that so I pretend like everything is ok so we can have a good time, I care a lot about how other people feel than how I feel, if that makes sense.  How does that make you feel? It makes me feel bad because I wish someone else can think like that, feel me, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? This is life man, it's just how life is, do you know what I mean? It's just how life is, you go through stuff it either makes you stronger or break you it will never break me I just tend to become, well, to me, I see it as I am being stronger but to other people it's it seems like I'm not being myself, you understand what I'm saying? To other people it seems like, cause me, I’m a loud bubbly person but because of certain situations that has happened kind of like mellowed me down and just humbled me in a way whereby I see things differently. And when you said that you prioritise others, you know, feelings and thoughts over yourself and then you, you know keep your emotions and bottle them inside you cause you don’t want other people to think of you as vulnerable, how does that make you feel when you keep all your emotions inside and not express yourself? It gets me lonely [laughing] cause when I go home, that’s where everything kind of like comes out of the bottle. It’s only when you are in your home and when you're in the shower do you know what I mean, that's when everything comes out. It makes me makes me it makes me upset but I have to, you have to be strong for others, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? I have to be strong for the people around me, for my loved ones. I have to be strong.  My loved ones can never see me crumble that's how I see as. I don't want my little ones to see me crumble do you get what i mean so I'm always acting like I'm the woman when deep inside i'm just a softy I’m like a teddy bear. Sounds like the opinion that others may hold of you, you value that? Yeah. I value other people's emotions I put people first before me I put people first before me but then that's just how, how I am that's just the, the person I am, I can't really change that I tried to change it but it's just who I am. Do you get what I'm trying to say to you? I can't change that do you get what I mean. It also sounds like you care about how other people think of you. Yeah a lot. But then that's when it comes about, that's' when it comes about fitting in, that's when it comes with fitting in cause I care a lot of how other people see me and what people think about me so I'm, I tend to, i'm not a follower, before I was a follower, my mum was saying you're a follower you follow what people say and what people do just so that you can feel belonging or you can feel part of it, do you understand what I'm saying but I feel like it's just age and stage, you get to certain age, you feel like you have to feel you're a part of everything but then when you get to a certain age you don't really care because you're trying to do you you're trying to achieve what you want to achieve for yourself, do you get what I'm trying to say to you so, yeah.  How did it make you feel when you, when you felt like you were trying to fit in or you were following others?  I wasn't, I still wasn't happy I wasn't happy and I found myself thinking other people can't make you happy but yourself because doing all that doing that, doing this, doing that, doing that to your body, doing that to your body or doing this doing that, for certain period of time I'm happy but afterwards i'm not happy. Do you understand what I'm saying so so we just learnt that other people can't make you happy but yourself it's all about your mindset like I said to you you you wake up in the morning and say ok I'm beautiful you can walk down the road like beyonce or you wake up and say I'm an ugly person, you have a bad day, do you know what i'm trying to say? It's all about your mindset, it's all about how you view your mind it's all about your mindset. Is there anything else you want to say box 2? No I don't, I wasn't sure about the other two because I didn't really think about it. I wasn't sure about the other two.  Sure, is there anything you want to say box 3? No. So what did you write? I put depressed.  Can you tell me a little more or or about depression?  What can I say? Whatever you'd like. I know, I'm trying to because I’ve kind of like covered most of it in the conversations, it just feels like I'm just repeating myself. If you feel like we've talked about it then don't worry about it. Because I just feel like I'm repeating myself. Should we move on to part 2 then? OK. PART 2 - Interview 45 - Female, 24, B&D Can we start by talking about what you put in box 1 please? For box one part one I put university. In university I feel like I was connected with everyone cos I've seen my friends, I see who I want to see, and in uni, I had the freedom to do what I wanted because i was living in campus so in uni that's when i feel like i was socially connected with everyone. Sorry, I think you mentioned that felt most lonely in uni? In my final year, yes. In my final year that's when I had to make a decision whether to hang out with certain people or to come out with certain people so I can get a grade that I wanted to get. But, when it comes to like socially connected, in university, my first and second year I feel like I was connected with everyone, all the latest gossips I know, all the latest this, I know and if i want to see someone it was easier because i have the freedom it was it was all, you know, all young people my age group, so, it was quite fun. So sounds like you felt like a part of something, you talked about the latest things you talked about different things, even gossips… Yeah. Go out, do things together, do you understand what I'm saying, whatever is happening on social media, the latest music come out, I know, because I was involved with certain people socially, it was fun. Whereby at home, if I'm at home, I'm not able, I was restricted in a way whereby i'm not able to do what I wanted to do, you get what i'm trying to say to you? So in uni, yes, in campus. And what else did you put in box 1? I put ‘at work’. In my workplace I feel socially connected as well because I have my friends there I have my workmates there we go out every Friday even if like to the pub, do you know what I mean because we work hard during the week so during the weekend we go out so at work yeah. And another one is when I'm around friends. Like if let's say for example I met up with a friend, catch up with the latest everything, you know what I'm saying, I feel more connected when i'm around certain people. So sounds like you like the idea of being around friends because there's things to do things to do, things to talk about… That's why I said I don't like being on my own. I only started being on my own recently I'm the kind of person I cannot be on my own I cannot sit on my own because if i sit down on my own I'm thinking so so I do it purposely not to think so I'm constantly around people because when you're around people you won't have time to sit down and think do you get what i'm trying to say to you so that's why I said that and at uni i'm always around people, at work, I'm constantly around people as well and always around friends. How does that make you feel now, when you spend time being being alone? I was wasting so many time, I was wasting time, i see as i was wasting time, I wasted most of my life because I couldn't finish uni time ago, I could have finished last year but I'm finishing this year because of the decision and around people I was in, do you understand what I'm saying? So, in a way I see it as, as a good thing, in a way because you can go out, forget about certain things, or, or they can either affect you in a negative way and I let it affect me in a negative way, do you understand what I'm saying because I could have finished uni last year but I only finish this year because I wasted one year thinking ‘oh, first-year don't count, I can go clubbing and do what i need to do do’, so it makes me feel like I wasted my life, I wasted 1 year of just socialising when I could have been doing something productive with my life. How does that make you feel when you feel like you've lost here? It makes me angry with myself it makes me upset with myself because I let that happen, do you understand what I'm saying, I made that happen. I had the opportunity to do something better but I didn't take that instead I wasted my life one year extra. Most of my friends that prioritised their times, they are doing the job they wanna do now, what am I doing, I'm looking for a job now, do you get what I'm trying to say to you so in a way I'm still i'm still paying for it, in a way, I'm still paying for that. Is there anything else you want to say about box 1? No, not really no. Probably my partner, another one could be my partner but it's alright. Can you tell me more about that? Yeah when I'm around my partner I'm a different person like with him it's just like yeah I feel accepted I feel like I could, I can be myself if that makes sense, without getting judged or without feeling like, ‘should I do this?’, do you know what I mean? I can be myself, so I feel most connected, socially connected with him cos I can be myself. How does that make you feel when your are you around him? Happy. You know when you know that you can be completely yourself… It makes me happy, he makes me really happy because that's all I want that's all I ever wanted and I was looking forward to it for time, do you understand what I'm saying? It makes me happy but at the same time, there's like a 50/50 because I shouldn't only be I shouldn't only feel a certain way around him I should be myself around everyone, do you get what I'm saying? Not just him, so yeah. So sounds like you've felt happy and felt a comfort zone. Yeah, like he's my comfort zone, yeah, yeah I can say that, yeah.  Because you can be yourself and you don’t have to worry about being judged. No So so sounds like your friends that you were with kind of judged you… Yeah. You had to be a bit careful in how you... Yeah, I literally have to dress a certain way, speak a certain way, just so that I feel like I'm part of them or so that they can accept me, do you get what i'm trying to say to you but with him in the morning I took out my wig, do you know what I mean. I'm like a different person, I can be me around him, do you get what i'm trying to say to you? I don't have to be someone else, so, yeah.  Is there anything else you want to say that box one? No, no, I was going to say church but no that's too deep. No, it's ok if you think so, whatever you think. Yeah, church, church could be one. Church is another one. Can you tell me more about that? Because in church no one is judging you, you're all the same you’re all sinners, do you get what I'm trying to say to you, you're all sinners, you're going there to to pray for God to forgive your sins or do you understand what I'm saying, no one is judging you, like everyone's just in the same position as you, do you get what i'm trying to say to you, so I can be myself there and in church kind of like pushed me to achieve greatness which is something that I wanted to do so when i'm around church i feel more connected, socially connected, do you understand what i'm saying, I'm talking to different people no matter how old they are, they can be someone old when I'm talking to them, i feel like we're the same, do you understand what i'm saying, we’re the same age whereby i feel i feel, I feel safe i feel secure like I feel really really good when i'm in church talking to certain people, it makes you feel motivated it makes you come out of church smiling ready to hit the following week, do you know what i mean, so. You get a sense of energy from what it sounds? Yeah, yeah. When you say it makes you feel secure, can you tell me more about that? Because I know I can say whatever I want to say there, no one can judge me, no one can tell me’ oh, don't do it this way do  it that way’, do you understand what I'm saying, so I feel secure I feel like I can trust them, do you get what I'm trying to say to you, I feel like I can trust them I can talk to them about literally anything and they can give me the right advice i know they won't tell me something they know will lead me into trouble later down the line or  not make me feel a certain way, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? I know if I talk to the right people there or not even the right people anyone I talk to there, I feel like they can give me the right advice and actually lead me to where I want to go in life, do you get what i'm trying to say to you? Just by talking to them. Is there anything else you want to say about box 1? No, probably, that’s it. yeah. Thank you, you can we talk about box 2 please? Place you feel most lonely at home, in the shower [laughing]. I think the shower for me, in the shower I feel lonely cause in the shower that’s literally my time, there’s no one there to disturb me, I'm there, it's just me, myself and my mind and my thought, do you know what I mean? So it’s just me. So, at home in my room, my room, my shower and in the car, these are the worst places for me. You only see me in my car, on my phone when I'm going through stuff because that's the only time I can sit down and think, do you understand what i'm saying and I’m scared of those places i'm literally terrified of these places because that's when I think about certain things I shouldn't even be thinking about, do you get what I'm trying to say to you, so yeah. It's nice in a way but then in a way it's not, especially in the shower - bring back memories or bring things I'm not ready yet to face, just, yeah, it’s just different ideas, but it's a good thing as well because in my shower I can come up with so many different ideas, do you get what I'm trying to say to you so, my home is, I feel my house is the worst place. You said that you know, it brings ideas you don’t want to face, can you tell me more about that. Like for example, like for example, recently I left Bedford to come back to london, I didn't want to leave Bedford, do you get what I'm trying to say to you but but I have to come I had to come i had a job in Bedford, I had everything, my life was already kind of like kicking, starting already, do you get what I'm trying to say to you but when in my, like, when I was in my room, I was thinking, you know what, maybe if I move to london, come to london, get a job, the opportunities there -  it's much better, I can get a place, I want to get into like housing, that's what I want to get into like renting, getting a mortgage and rent it out to young people, that something that i want to do so when i'm on my own i think about ideas like that, I'm not ready to, financially, i'm not ready for, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? Me thinking about it just put more pressure on to me, do you get what i'm trying to say to you so i'm not ready, I don't really like thinking about things like that in a way that's what I mean by when I say I'm scared of certain things, yeah. How does that  make you feel when you're in the shower or in a car? Sometimes I’m happy sometimes I'm just scared. The more you get older the more you face different things in life, do you get what I'm trying to say to you, so I do get scared but it's just life.Llike, for example, I left everything in bedford to come to London to start all over again, that was scary for me, do you get what i'm trying to say to you, it was scary for me but it's a decision I had to make, that in the long run it's going to benefit me, it might not benefit me at this period of time but later down the line it will benefit me, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? And did you feel lonely at home too apart from the shower? Yeah. Cause your house, that's where you are on your own, that's when you're by yourself you have no distractions, nothing to distract you, you're on your own and that's when life hits you hard, that's when you think about things on your own in your house. In my house, yeah, in my room, my room, yeah, as well sometimes I play music play, play TV just to take my mind off of it but it's something you can't run away from, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? You can't run away from it, so. And, so like you mentioned home, how about your family members, do they, like, when you're in the living room, for example or you… I live on my own so I’m literally on my own. I go to my mum and dad sometimes when I want to visit but I live on my own, do you get what I mean? So that's even worse because when you're on your own, all you do is think, so yeah I have plenty of time to think [laughing] that I even run away from sometimes, I just go to my mum's house just for going there, do you know what i mean, so. Is there anything else you want to say? No, I've thought about it, no.  Sounds like you want to escape your thoughts or accept what is is by distracting yourself, going to your parents, like for example going to your parents and stuff.  Yeah, yeah. Cos if, it depends on your personality. If you're someone that thinks a lot, like me I think a lot, the littlest thing would get to my head. I'm someone that thinks 24/7 I'm thinking, do you understand what i'm saying, so I tend to run away from it sometimes because when it becomes too much it's just puts me in a mood I don't want to, do you understand what i'm saying? So I tend to run away from it, sometimes i do face it but most times i run away from it because it just it just puts me in a mood I don't like being in, feeling lonely, feeling depressed, feeling lonely is one of the worst feelings in the world, worst feelings in the world because you just feel like you're by yourself it's just you in this big old place, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? And I don't like being, feeling like that. I don't like, I don't like doing that. When you said this big old place, can you tell me more about that? Like when you're on your own you just you just see the world differently man. I sound like a weirdo in it? No, not at all. [laughing] You just see the world differently, you just see like, it's just you and the world is against you, I don't know how to put it man. You just feel like you're in a little wall, you know, like have you been, I don't know how to explain it, you just feel like you're in a little, little pic (1:20:43 - pic?) and there's no one there it’s just you, I don't like being in that kind of mindset or frame, do you understand what I’m saying? Like I said to you, I’m a thinker, I think a lot, even like my mum tells me it's not good. I think a lot, I think about the smallest thing, the slightest thing I think about, I overthink things, I'm an overthinker, that's the word.  When you say you're an overthinker can you tell me more? I don't know how to give an example, like I just I don't know man, something I shouldn't be worried about I'm worried about it. When you say you're worried about it can you tell me more? Like, how can I say it? I don't know how I don't know what example to give, let's say for example… You don’t have to give me an example. Yeah but I need to, I don't know how to explain it. Like I think about, I'm the kind of, I’ll think about my future and I'm worried about my future when I don't even know what the plan is what the plan that God has for me, do you understand what I'm saying? I over, I think, I just think and think and think, overthink. My mum always says take one step at a time. I'm not that person I like planning and i'm very what's the word organised, is organised the word? I want to plan this and then and then it go this way, I don't know how to put it man. Sounds like you are you afraid of something that you don’t know. Do you get what I'm trying to say to you? Then, that kind of makes me think a lot and just put me in a mood that I don't, I'm afraid of being because being in that mood, it affect people around me, do you get what i'm trying to say to you? I hurt other people around me because i don't know how to control it it's not an angry raging but it's just like, i'm just mute, i'm just quiet, do you understand what i'm saying? I don’t want to do nothing, I'm just, I’m just, what's the word, quiet and just think about things I shouldn't really be thinking about if, if that's the word. When you say, like, when you worry about the future or think about the future, can you tell me more? Like what is it about the future that you worry about or scared about? Everything. Everything. I want to do better than my parents. Everything. Like I want to get my own, I want to get mortgage, I wanna, it's just everything, my little goals because I like setting goals and actually meeting them, do you understand what I'm saying? If I don't meet my goals I feel disappointed and I get really hard on myself, do you know what I'm trying to say to you? I'm just, I don't know man, it's weird man. It sounds like you're a competitive person? Ok that's one, I am, very, I don't know man, it's just weird man. it's not weird. It's a weird, it's a weird trait. Since I was young I'm like that but then it's cause i'm, do you know when you come from poverty, I don't know if, what background you come from but when you’ve come from poverty, you don't want to go back to poverty, do you get what I'm trying to say to you? You want to come from that, do you understand what i'm trying to say to you? Like I feel like that's what messes with my brain a little bit, it really plays with my brain cause i've come from nothing to where I am now, I've worked my way, it's not where I want to be in life but it's, I'm getting there, do you get what I'm trying to say? I'm taking the steps, that's, I feel like, yeah that's what messes my head cos I think a lot, too much thinking is not good, it’s not good.  So sounds like you're worried that you don't want to go back to... No, no. I don't wanna, I don’t wanna to go back from not eating to going to bed not, without no eating, i don't want to go back to that, I don't want my kids to go through that, do you understand what I'm trying to say to you? I want my kids to get a better future than me, do you understand what I mean? I used to go to school with no food, no nothing but I still go to school because I was angry cause I wanna do better. I wanna take my mom from that, do you get what I’m trying to say to you? So, it's all about, I don't know, it's very weird [laughing]. It sounds like you are a goal oriented person. Yeah. And, how does that make you feel when you put yourself... I put, I put too much pressure on myself and when I fail I get really, really, I get really really upset with myself. I feel like it's not good because I put too much pressure on myself. It's good in a way because it's kind of like kicks you up the ass to kind of like keep going but at the same time it puts too much pressure on you, as a person. So sounds like you put pressure on yourself? I have to, you have to. I came from nothing. I don’t want my brothers to go through the same things I went through. I go to uni to set an example for them, do you get what I'm saying? They have to follow it. They have to, they have to. I have to be hard because I'm the older one in the family, so,  we have a thing whereby we say the older one in the family goes through a lot because all the younger ones kind of like following you, they’re following your steps. I'm always hard on myself, you have to be hard on yourself, you have to in life. If not, life will bring you down man, trust me, I can never be part of the, I don't know how to put it, I can never be part of them, if that makes sense, I'm me, do you i'm trying to say to you? Is there anything else you want to say about box 2? No , I think that’s it. Thank you very much. "
