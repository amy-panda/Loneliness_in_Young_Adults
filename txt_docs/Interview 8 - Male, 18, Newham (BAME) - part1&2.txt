I’ve put isolation and depressed. Okay, can you tell me about that, please? I feel like if you experience loneliness, you just kind of be isolated from everyone and you just feel like very depressed and just, just want to be alone most of the time as well, so yeah. So, so you're saying that loneliness is associated with isolation? Um, okay, what, how does that make you feel? Hmm, sad, like it's very depressing because you're always alone, sometimes it can make people feel suicidal because they feel like they have nobody, so yeah. So, it's the feeling that they think that there's no one. Yeah. Okay, can you tell me more about that? Um, alright in the second box I even drew *gets interrupted* Before we move on to the second box, I was just thinking… unless it’s related to this one. I think they’re all kind of interlinked Okay, um… I think let's focus on the first one for now and then we can go to the next one. Alright, cool. So, okay, sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt your flow. That's alright. So yeah, tell me more, so like when you say that, you know, you might be feeling depressed and so on, um can you tell me more about that? I feel like you are just less sociable and you just kind of, just feel like you have nobody, so you just kind of, I don't know, I guess like secluded from everything and everyone, so you just feel like you're very alone in a world where it's very interactive. That's what I think. And so being excluded is what sort of contributes to loneliness. Yeah, the feeling, because for, the experience of loneliness, I feel that’s like when you feel like nobody understands you, and you feel like nobody is there for you, so you just feel like you're kind of excluded from everything. So, so, if people don't understand you or people don’t understand others, um then they feel that they're not understood. Yeah. Tell me more about that. I feel like, because I see like, the way we interact I feel like we tend to kinda like distance ourselves from people that we feel like they won't understand how we feel and how the way we work, yeah. So if people don't understand, so you're saying that people, if people don't understand you then you're likely to kind of dissociate yourself. Yeah. Okay, and how does that make you feel? *pause* You feel alone, yeah… kind of like secluded very secluded. Um… so, okay, so you're saying that if people don't understand you or if they don't know what's going on with you, then, then, that kind of results in that, yeah, that makes you feel lonely, if people don’t understand you. Yeah. Um… ok, and tell me more about your exp-, yeah tell me more about when people don’t understand you. I feel like, with the way, um you kind of like disclose your own, kind of information of yourself and like you tend to want to see if someone feels the same way, or have like similar experiences, so that way, it's just that you're more comfortable, because you know the way they think is similar to you, so you would just feel like, like there is, there is actually people out there that actually make, make you feel better about yourself and just so you just don't feel like you're just not the only one that you feel that same, that type of certain way. So, if you, if you see that someone is also going through the same difficulties as you or if someone shares similar interests as you then that helps in a way… Yeah … prevents loneliness. Yeah. Tell me more about that. Because I feel like if you have like same experiences, you are more, because you just like kind of reciprocate kind of advices of how you deal with it and how they deal with it and maybe that could help you deal with your situation and the way you can give them advice of how you dealt with it, maybe could help other people as well, so it’s a matter of reciprocating. Okay, and how would that make you feel? What if I was able to reciprocate advice? Yeah, if you knew that for example, like, people like you, for example, out there, you could recipro-, reciprocate advice and things like that. Hmm, it kind of makes me happy, like if I can help somebody, bring a smile to their face and make sure they are okay, then yeah, I don’t really, it don’t really, there’s not much to it, I just feel satisfied in knowing that I made someone else, help make them better with their situation or whatever they're going through. Okay, is there anything else you want to say about the first one? No. Okay, um… can we talk about what you’ve put in the second box? So, in the second one, I kind of drew like a representation of how you would, like how you'd see society, so you'll be you by yourself, individually, and there will be like crowds of people, who are interacting and there will be like even relationships, where it's just two people, so you're not really feeling alone and there will be like group of friends as well and then, if you’re experiencing loneliness so you will just be individual, just by yourself. Hmm. In fact, that’s what the experience of loneliness would look like. So, tell me about this one. So that will be like for someone who experienced loneliness, so I just put as me, so let’s just say if I felt the experience of loneliness that's how I would see society and how I would feel, I would feel that there’ll be people who can interact with each other and people who’d be in relationships and group of friends, while in the experience of loneliness, I'll just be by myself. Okay, so, tell me about, tell me about this one, in a crowd, um… … interacting? Interacting, in relation to this one. I feel like there will be a lot of people who can interact together and it will be more easier for people who are not lonely, than someone who is experiencing loneliness, they will find it difficult to kind of socialize and kind of open up if they're in, experiencing loneliness for a long time. So, you're saying that, basically like you might find it difficult to disclose to others or share something personal to others… Yeah, I feel because it will be more difficult, I feel like you have, you kind of feel very anxious because I feel like it's difficult for someone to kind of just openly say a lot of things about themselves and we just like kind of slowly build. And how would that make you feel not being able to disclose to others? Personally, I'll just kind of like, I'll just try to get on with it, I’ll just like, just, just not really think too much about it, but for other people it can be different, so some people may, it might be a big issue for someone else, but I feel like if you have like coping mechanisms, and I guess you kind of can substitute your loneliness with something else that may make you feel less alone. Tell me more about those coping mechanisms. So, for me, if I ever felt lonely, I'll probably just watch a lot of TV-shows, Netflix, I kind of just be on the internet, so I'm more, so even if I can't socialize in real life, I can just socialize through the net, and with other people that may have that similar interest. And another way it could be just listening to music, just like being spiritual as well, so even religion can be a huge part of it as well, I just talk to the god, to God and so, if I ever felt lonely. You mentioned that you would basically watch or interact online or engage yourself online, can you tell me more about that? So, knowing like a lot of things are globalized, so we are able to interact with people on the net, so I feel like, because if I'm watching something on like on my laptop and I can just see comments, I can see people who are watching the same thing as me, and I think that’s an easy way to interact with people that watch similar things as me and just, it will be easier to conversate, adding from there, anything could happen from there, you can form a friendship, relationship from that and it's just easy to like feel less lonely. So, seeing, for example, other people commenting on something that you’re watching allows you to kind of… Kind of initiate, kind of like conversation, or like to discuss more about something that you've, you might have a passion on discussing about. So, having something in common. Yeah. Okay, thank you, you also mentioned something about Netflix, can you tell me more about that? Yeah, for me Netflix is, it's a big factor for me, because I watch a lot of TV shows, like I'm just, I like entertainment, so I do a lot of things that just satisfy my entertainment purposes, kind of thing. So, I’ll just like watch Netflix because I just enjoy watching like TV shows, other people's lives and yeah, pretty much it. Hmm. I feel like if I, because I'm, like if I feel lonely, I'll probably watch other people's lives and just kind of be happy for them, so it's like I substitute my, I don’t even think about myself, I feel like I just watch other people's lives and it just somehow just makes me feel better. Tell me more about it, when you see other people's lives. Like I may watch people who are enjoying just family or just like, with like their partners, it just, it's just, it’s nice to see something that I wish to have, so for it to be actually happening, I just, just, it's just nice to watch other people and how they interact and maybe if it ever happens to me, I will just know how to deal with the situation, if I ever came to it. And how does that make you feel when you watch other people's lives, the things that they have, that you don't have, for example. At first I get sad, but then I feel like I have hope that it could, it could happen to any of us, so I feel like if there's a possibility that I could possibly find love. Hmm, so when you, for example, when you said, when you feel lonely, you, that's when you want to watch Netflix and then when you see other people's lives and when they have the things that you have, that you don't have, for example, how does that impact you sense of loneliness? It kind of, I feel like it minimizes it a bit because I just, I feel like it's a closure kind of way, like if I'm able to watch other people, I don't, it just satisfies me in some way, weird way, but I don't know, I just, it just makes me feel better and I just get on with my day. You mentioned something as a third one, I’m trying to think what you said… um… Religion. Religion, yeah, can you tell me more about that. So being a Muslim and growing up in a household where parents are religious, like religious when it comes to Islam, so it's like I've been kind of brought up in a way where if I ever feel like, even if it’s a good day or bad day, I should always turn to God and talk to God about it, and actually it's like therapeutic in a way. So, I just feel good in that, knowing that I'm kind of expressing the way I feel and that there’s somebody who, because we believe that he is all-knowing and all-powerful so, and he will bring mercy to us, so yeah, I feel like it’s a key coping mechanism for me to always return to God. So, religion helps you with your loneliness. Yeah. Can you tell me about these ones? So, these are like relationships and group of friends, so for someone who don't have like group of friends and anyone, like as a relationship or in a, like as a partner, I feel like that's what, how they would see, see kind of like their world, so it would just be them strictly and kind of like a barrier and it would just be the people who are very interactive. What do you mean with ‘there’s a barrier’? Like, obviously it’s like a barrier like this. So, for example, other people, for example, might be in good friendships or in a partnership relationship and then this individual is kind of *gets interrupted* … *continues* secluded from everything. Tell me about that. Like, I feel like, the way, things like, if someone’s experiencing loneliness they would, they would kind of feel put off, kind of thing, from a lot of things and they will have like loss of energy because I believe, if you're experiencing loneliness, it kind of, you’re kind of like, you're depressed and I feel like you just kind of seclude yourself from everyone, like you willingly do that, like even though you may feel like you want to interact with people, but you just don't really feel, like you feel very lethargic and fatigued, so it's just, it’s like you aren’t really, it's just, you’re not really motivated to do it, to interact, you feel like it’s better to be alone than to communicate with other people, so, that's what I think. How does that make you feel? For me, I don't really experience a lot of loneliness because I've got my group of friends and other people that I chat to on a regular basis, so, and I really interact, like I go out a lot and stuff, so I don't really feel that, but when I come home, I just I don't know, I feel like it’s another personality, kind of thing, it’s just like, I believe that there’s three personalities, there’s one with your friends, one with your family and when you're by yourself and I, when you're by yourself, it's just more kind of like depressed, like lowered mood, kind of thing, because you're just, you're just alone, you’re not interacting with people, you just, it's just you and yourself, so yeah. Tell me more about that, what kind of a personality would that be? I don't know, I feel like it's really kind of, I wouldn’t, I wouldn't say down to earth, but I would say similarly, you just really, just, you know, kind of just chill, not really do much just, just do what you enjoy, that kind of thing and then yeah pretty much. So, you do what you enjoy, can you tell me more about that? So what I do for enjoyment, I play games, I watch Netflix, as well, I just literally, just like FaceTime, group call with my friends, as well, in my, whenever I’m alone, yeah other than that, I just really, just sleep and just, just literally chill, just you know, listen to music, just go on the internet, just social media in like in general. Tell me more about social media. I feel like without social media, I feel like I would be depressed because I'm always invested in people and so I would just always be on social media a lot and you know just scrolling down, looking at videos, just really interacting on social media a lot, because it's a, I feel like it’s a huge part of my life, because as we like we live in a digital, digital age is it's always around you and stuff. So, it's more like, I'm just literally a victim to the society of globalization because I know like social media, too much social media is bad for you and it's just like yeah, that's about it. Tell me more about… … social media. Because you said that it's bad for you. Yeah. Can you tell me about that? Because I feel like if you are on social media a lot, you kind of become so engrossed in just the virtual world, you really kind of lose the functions of interacting in real life, and I've seen it happen to a lot of people, they, they would be on social media a lot and when it comes to like face-to-face interaction, they're like very awkward, they don’t know how to be approachable and they’re very closed people, yeah. And how-how-how, so can, how would that make you, yeah, how does that make you feel? I feel like, like there should be like a cap, when it comes to how much social media usage you can use, because I feel like, it's just very, it can bec-, it can become toxic, because social media is, it shouldn't be what we are so engrossed in, it should just be there for like, when you're on your break or just catching up with what's happening at the gossip, Daily News. It should not be to the point where you're literally waking up your, on social media, going, on the way to school, working, on your breaks, coming home, before you sleep, it shouldn't be where it's like a routine, like the way you, it shouldn't be like a routine, it should just be, just like, you just access it, should just be like a simple access, not really what it should be a second nature to. Hmm, and um, tell me more about um… so, you said that you go on to social media, invest a lot of time on it, right? Yeah. Tell me more about what you do. I, most of the time, I just go on Instagram to just watch funny videos or just like, just watch videos of other people, kind of thing and I just yeah, I just, sometimes I shop online, I just talk to all my friends, just really, just interact with people that I wouldn’t be interacting with if I wasn’t at home, if I like, the people I would interact with are the people that I would be out with, I'll just come home and I'll be able to interact with them again, but most of the time if I'm with them the whole day, I’ll just come home and just do what I wouldn't do if I was out, so like watch, like catch up with what I was watching, eating, all the basic necessities, kind of thing, yeah. You mentioned something about browsing on social media, can you tell me more about that? I browse a lot, I just, every time I just, I don't know, it's just something like, I don't know how to explain it, just, I just, I just keep scrolling, scrolling, I just, you just, I can't stop, because it's just like, it's so entertaining, I feel, because entertainment is a big factor for me, I feel like I'm, I'm so easily distracted and I really like to be entertained a lot as well, something that will satis-, satisfy my needs and mine is entertainment a lot. So, browsing really entertains me because it's just like, I'm always getting an interesting fact about just like things I don't know and it's just always on my feed and I'll just be able to learn something out, you learn, you learn, you learn new things every single day and so I feel like browsing is a way that that happens. Hmm, like when you see things on your social media feed, is it generally more about like other people or is it *gets interrupted* Yeah, it’s a lot, it’s all, like social media is a lot about other people, it’s sometimes yeah, it's just like, sometimes it's like things to be aware of and yes, things that we should be kind of doing to make a change and sometimes just, just entertainment purposes or just like funny videos, cat videos, dog videos, something like that. And you will even have like influences, as well, so they may influence you to do things that you may not feel comfortable, when it comes to like people really telling you, because I feel like influencer, they, influencers they do things in, on a social media basis because it's more easier for someone to like, for them to relate to something on the net, than they can in real life because of like insecurities and stuff. Sorry, say that again. So, I feel like when it comes to like influencers, like you'll see a lot on social media and that is a big factor, because they kind of help you look at things the way that you wouldn't see in real life, like in the outside world other than social media. Can you tell me about that? So, I'll give an example, let's just say weight loss, a lot of people when it comes to that, they don't really kind of acknowledge, like they acknowledge that they may be fat or skinny, but they wouldn't kind of feel influenced to actually do something about it motivate, whereas on social media there's a lot of motivational like influencers where they tell you ‘Oh, you should start doing something about your health etc.’, and I feel like that's a huge part of social media, as well, just a lot of people trying to influence you to do things, they, influencers, influencers, they actually try to make you stay away from social media, so that's why they, I don't know that's how I feel how it works, they tell you to do things outside of social media, because we're so engrossed in social media and I think that's why you kind of experience loneliness, because you're so much, you’re so engrossed in technology that you kind of, kind of forget that the real world functions and that you live in a real world, like in a 3D-world. Tell me more about um, your experience of loneliness with social media. I think, whenever I feel, if I ever feel lonely, I'll just go on social media, I'll just, just do a lot of, like what I would do is just you know, I talk to friends if I feel like, if I feel a bit down, feel a bit lonely, just talk to friends and hopefully they can give me advice that will make me feel better, this is, this is rarely though, like I don't really feel lonely, I just, I just feel chilled most of the time. And um… and you mentioned that you browse on your social media, you watch different things and eventually you communicate with your friends online, on social media, um can you tell me more about… the feelings that you experience when you're on social media? I feel good, I feel very satisfied, I feel, I feel, I don’t know, I feel powerful in a way, like I'm just, I'm so connected like with everybody and everything, like I literally feel like I have the whole world in my fingertips, because I'm so, it’s so easily accessible for a lot of like… anything, anything, you just literally go and google and you can search whatever and a lot of things will come, not just one thing, a million things will come up, so I feel like I'm so connected to just like resource, I’m, easily like I got a lot of resource just through technology, yeah. You mentioned something about music, can you tell me more about that? Music? I listen to music every single day, I feel like music is a, is a big factor in my life because, I don't know, if I ever feel sad, I will listen to music just to kind of lift my mood, if I'm just chilling I listen to music, it's just, I don't know, it's just auditory satisfaction in a way, so it's just that I love, I just love hearing sounds, so that's why I'd been trying to become a musician myself, so I’d try play the piano, guitar and just try to be creative in a way. Hmm, and you said, you know, you listen to music when you're feeling sad. Yeah, I feel like whenever I'm sad, I just feel like I don't know, I just need to listen to something just to kind of get my mind away from like that feeling, so that will put me in a more calm state, because I feel like when I listen to music, it’s only when I'm calm, so I feel like if I listen to music it will change, kind of switch the way I think and make me in a, calm or even happier way, because some music are happy, so yeah. Okay, is there anything else you want to say about that? Nope. Okay, can we start talking about your next one, please? So, the third one is kind of what, kind of interlinked with the first one, as well, it’s like when you're always at home, you're less sociable, sad music, desperate for interaction, I feel like when people who experience loneliness they kind of try not feel lonely, so they will try to interact with people and I feel like a lot, because I see a lot of people, they tend to listen to sad music when they feel sad, which is, I feel like, personally, is the worst thing to do and to be less sociable as well, so they will kind of, like I said, they quite exclude themselves from everyone and just try to be alone because they feel like that's the best way they can handle the situation and they’ll just be always at home because from, if you're not home and you’re, it’s like you're exposed to the society and people, and that's like, when you're lonely, I don't know, I feel like, because I kind of put lonely and associate it with like kind of depressed, so I feel like when you're depressed you'll kind of always stay at home, you don't wanna go outside, you just want to always just be inside in your own comfortable environment. Um… okay, so tell me more about the association between loneliness and depression? I feel like when you're lonely it’s easy for you to be depressed, I feel like you just like, when you, because I feel like the symptoms of just being lonely kind of mirrors the way of being depressed as well, so you just feel sad, you will have low mood, sometimes you'll be angry because just frustr-, out of frustration and sometimes it could lead to suicide and having suicidal thoughts. So, you mentioned always at home, less… … sociable. Less sociable… Sad music. Sad music, depressed thought. Desperate for interaction. Desperate for interaction... Yeah. Can you tell me about that? I feel like sometimes, when you’re experiencing lonely, and you get really frustrated, you kind of, you, you actually be more, sometimes you will feel motivated, some people will feel more motivated to kind of interact with people, so they will kind of go out their way to try to interact and yeah, I just feel that’s, that's how sometimes it works out. If you feel lonely, you'll try to prevent feeling lonely, so you’ll do anything but feeling lonely, so you’ll do everything like, that can prevent you from experiencing that kind of feeling so, so they will try to be interactive as much as possible. Hmm… tell me more about that. What, interactions? Like tries to make the effort to interact with others. I feel like because humans we are social, we're sociable animals and we are based on communicating like through symbols, language and it's, it’s in our nature, I feel like it’s an instinct for, for humans to interact, so I feel like if, because that's, I feel like that’s a main factor, like when you, when you are born, the first thing you're, you're interacting with the parent, like you're not aware of it, but you are interacting and sometimes like if you don't have that, you kind of be, it can, it can affect you in like different ways and stuff. And then you put sad music and less sociable. Yeah. Tell me more about that. So, less sociable, I’d say, they, I've full, like they will lose the quality of being able to be socialized, like to be socialized, like kind of, like social life and I feel like some will just, because of that they will be more, more quiet, less sociable, less talkative and be those kind of like introvert and just not really out there, outgoing, approachable and put sad music because whoever feels lonely, I feel like, they will just kind of listen to like sad music, kind of, I don't know, I just, because I see it a lot, people who ever feel lonely or sad, they will listen to sad music, they will just resort to feeling even more sad, which I feel, I feel like it’s stupid, but I guess it helps people in a way and just makes them like, yeah, there’s not much to it. So, you’re saying it helps them? Yeah, I feel like it's a way they kind of cope or like, because I feel like this, that’s a way they think it’s similar, that they’ll be feeling the similar experience of the, maybe the artist who are talking about it, like relatable stuff in the song, so they probably resort to that and just kind of, yeah kind of, kind of like interact with the music because of the lyrics they, they are listening to. So, you were saying that music be it sad or happy is a coping mechanism. Yeah, I feel like because when you listen to music, in general, it’s like a way to divert your mind from something that could cause you stress and so I feel like, they would listen to music and it kind of relates to how they’re feeling, in a way, I don't know why, but it's just, I guess it feels good for some people, yeah. Hmm… okay. Do you want to say anything else? Nope. Can we start by talking about what you've put in the final box? So, the final box I put secluded, so it's just literally combining everything that's in all boxes into one simple word, which is secluded, like secluded, like being secluded from society, from yourself, from the way you think, I feel like when you're secluded like you, whenever you feel loneliness, you are secluding yourself from other people because you feel like you're the only person who feels that certain type of way, so they would kind of just, automatically think ‘yeah, nobody will understand me, so I’m, the better way is just to go off by myself and that's why I feel like secluded is kind of like, feels like you’re secluded yeah. ‘Nobody understands me’, tell me more about that. So I feel like whenever you feel sad or experience loneliness, you tend to feel like ‘oh I'm the only one who’s going through it’, because at the time you all, you are the one who's going through it, so you feel like, because people around you at the time are maybe or at that moment you feel like nobody is feeling the way I'm feeling, so I feel like I'm the only one who feels this type of way and like I don't think anyone else will feel that, and it’s just that, you make it, you generalize, kind of thing, you feel like ‘oh, you are the only person in this world that will feel that kind of way’ and how nobody will understand you, because everyone is different everyone has like, like different positional factors, so I feel like, so everyone will feel like ‘oh yeah, because I'm a different type of person, I will feel this type of way and no one can be similar, exact same, like feel the same, the exact same way’. So there's a thinking that you are the only one going through this, the one that no one is, that feeling… Yeah, feeling like, you’re feeling alone, so you’re just like, you feel secluded, I feel like when you're secluded you ex-, you even feel, even more lonely, like as much as you're feeling, already feeling lonely, you will feel even more lonely because you're, you're like intentionally excluding yourself from things that could actually make you feel even, better. I feel like, because, I feel like, feeling, like emotions in general, it's like, like clouds in a way, so it just, it comes and it goes and I feel like that's how it pays off, when it comes to loneliness, so they first of all, see themselves, make them feel, as much as they feel, like overwhelmed and like let the, let the cloud go past and then I, because there's always good and bad days, there's never just one permanent day, so yeah. When you said the emotions come and go, can you tell me more about that? Because I feel like, with emotions you, everybody will feel every single emotion that there is, that is possible, humanly possible and they will, they’re not always permanent, it's just, it's just sometimes they're more longer than others and sometimes people feel like, because it's for a very long time, they feel like it’s kind of permanent or it will never get better or it'll never get worse, so yeah, I feel like people, just generally, just kind of, when in the moment, I feel like when they have that adrenaline and all that emotion, emotion rush they tend to think to the worse and so they yeah they think pessimistically than optimistically. So, that's why I feel like when it comes to like emotions in general and how they just come and go, because personally I feel like emotions, they’re, it's like, you'll just, it’s temporary, so there's always a balance, so if there's good days, there's always going to be bad days, when there's bad days, there’s always gonna be good days, so that's how I see, like things are. Okay, and so when you said secluded, like secluded from what? I said so, secluded, I’d say through like, secluded from people, yes just secluded from people, kind of way, because loneliness is literally, for me, I’d, I’d define that as away from people, away from interaction and secluded, it's like you're willingly to do that and I feel like a lot of people, who feel lonely would do that, because they feel like they're the only people that feel the s-, some type of way and they don't want to kind of exert their energy their, their feelings to other people which me, for me, people, for people, like make other people like feel bad about themselves and like negative energies, they don't want to kind of like let that flow around other people as well, so they kind of seclude themselves and let them deal with it, than kind of influence other people feeling that kind of energy and all. Okay, so you’re saying that people don't necessarily want to tell about their, tell their, how they're feeling to other people, because they don't want to, they don't want them to feel bad about themselves… Because I feel like, when they tend to do this, because they don't want, if they're feeling bad, they like, if they’re feeling sad or lonely, they don’t want to feel, they don't want people to feel the same way they feel, because they know how much it’s maybe hurtful or painful and maybe they don’t want other people to feel that way. So, for example, that's how I would personally see it, as if I, if I felt lonely, I'll just seclude myself and just deal with it, then kind of like interact with other people, because I didn't want to give that bad energy, that sad energy to other people who are more happy, optimistic, not feeling sad, I don't want to give that kind of energy to other people, who do not want that kind of feeling, let’s say. Hmm, so you’re saying that yeah, so you’re saying that basically you don't want people to kind of get a negative energy from you, so you are associating, um express, expression of loneliness with a negative energy… Yeah, a negative energy, I don't, I don't see how loneliness can give a positive energy. Okay, um… and how does that make you feel? Hmm, personally, I feel like it’s, I feel like that's a good way of dealing with it, just do it by yourself and then just yeah, just dealing with it yourself because we die and we are born alone, so I feel like the only way we can like, the only way to truly, really and truly you can deal with loneliness and the way you feel is through yourself, and like I don't feel like yeah, there could be external factors that could help and influence the way you feel, but it really truly down, comes down, goes to you. Okay, tell me more about when you said you are born alone and you die alone. I feel like because we're all going to be in a grave which is just literally us, our body and that's it, and when we are born, it's, okay, it may be different for when you are born, but I said that because you, you’re individually put on this Earth and have a purpose on this Earth, so it's just like you are more independent and individual rather than in a group, collective, kind of way and yeah, and when you die, you do not kind of, like it’s, because in the grave you are by yourself and whoever, if you, if you believe in religion or not, wherever, you're going to be judged by your sins, not other, other people sins and you're going to be judged on what you've done, on what… yeah, what you’ve done and what you’ve contributed to religion, in a way. Okay, is there anything else you want to say? That's pretty much it. Okay, thank you.

Hmm, in the first box, I’ve put ‘circus’, it’s the name of a theatre and a cafe in my local area, and this is where back in, when I went to college, we used to revise there and all of like, all of my group of friends would just always be there, we would even chill sometimes, just interact, just literally, just conversate and that's just like, I feel very connected with everyone there and I’ve put, I’ve also put college, as well, because when I used to go, I'm just constantly around people, like in classes, it's literally everyone, like it's the more, I feel like it's, the education system is where you're most socially interactable, because you're around a group of people, who are doing the same thing as you and are going to the same path as you, kind of way, and, and I’ve put some, I’ve put my home, as well, because I'm like, my family is always at home, I'm able to like conversate, you know, interact with my family members, yeah. Okay, so you mentioned school and family, or college and family, so these make you feel socially connected. Yeah. What is it about family that you feel more socially connected? For me, I'm always around my family and for me, family is a key, like it's a, it's an important part of me and if I didn't have my family, I feel like I don't have anything, kind of way, because um it's just my family, I care about them the most and they’re the people who I go to the most and I'm with them literally every single day and every single like second of my life, so it's like because I'm so used to them being around, it's just like without that, I would just really feel lonely. Hmm… And for college, I feel like college is where you meet new people, where you are, are expected to kind of socialize and make friends, kind of thing, so it's just like, it's just yeah, it's just like, it’s a, it’s like an inner environment, where you are expected to be sociable and yeah, kind of interact in a way. So you, you said home as well, as well as college, um tell me more about your college environment. My college environment is pretty, pretty sociable and it's a very sociable environment, like we have like classes where, there will be big classes, as well, because we have a lot of people in our year and um we would have like a, like little rooms where you can go study with your friends, we would have benches outside, we would have like events that kind of bring us closer, so events like choir, football, basketball, just sp-, things that people like will enjoy and it will just bring us closer and so I would feel so connected with everyone around me. So, doing things that you enjoy with others, basically prevents you from feeling lonely. Yeah. Okay and, um, and with your family, tell me about your family environment. So, my family environment it's like, I just get along with my family, I just you know, just like when we eat we’re always together, we just discuss our day or we just talk about anything, it's like, there is like, you could literally just talk about anything, you have nothing to worry about, kind of thing and like yeah, if you feel upset or like you had a good day, you just tell your parents, your sisters and siblings and yeah, and I regularly go and see my cousins and stuff, so, it's like I'm really connected to them a lot, so yeah. So, you're saying that basically you don't have to worry about hiding anything, or you, you are fully open with your family and, and that kind of stuff. Yeah, I'm really open with my family. Okay, is there anything else you want to say? That's pretty much it. Okay, can you start talking about the second box, please? So, in the lonely box, I’ve put bedroom, because when you're in your bedroom, it's like and it's like, when you're in your bedroom, sometimes it's, it’s where you sleep and when you sleep it's like, it's always dark and it's quiet so in, and it’s literally just by yourself and it kind of mirrors like, kind of mirrors like how, I don't know, it wouldn’t mirror, I would just say like that's how you would feel when it comes to feeling lonely, it would just be you in a dark room, quiet, very quiet and just yeah so I feel like that's the only place where I would personally feel like it’s lonely, because you're literally there in the s, in silence, in, in the dark as well, which sometimes it’s, it’s associated with like sadness and like, like depressive, like depressive stuff as well and yeah, and I just feel like that's the only place where I can personally feel like, I would feel lonely, because it's just literally where I’m physically alone, so yeah. You said darkness, can you tell me more about that? Darkness is like, I feel like, if a, in darkness, it’s like you’re not in a happy place, so like the contrast between light and dark, it would just be similar to good and bad, so I feel like, I like, yes all good and bad and like happy and sad, so darkness I’ll just associate it with sadness as well and then like, like that sad energy and like negative energy and stuff like that in the darkness, as well, because really you can’t see nothing, it’s just pitch black, just yeah, it’s just, sometimes it could be terrifying to people, not me personally, but it's just people who may see it as terrifying, afraid, so it's just like, it’s kind of associated with a lot of negative emotions, so yeah. Tell me more about the negative emotions. So, like, you’ll feel like, sometimes darkness can be associated with like anger, evil, hatred and then sometimes it’s like sad, pain, alone, like lonely a lot as well, yeah, that's the kind of emotion I kind of associate with loneliness. So, you're saying that your room is dark and that brings about sort of feelings of anger and things like that. Not anger entirely, just like, it's like really like downtime for me, so just like, I’ll feel sleepy, I’ll just feel like kind of drowsy and just not, not like I would, I would, you would just be everything that is the contrast of like happy, energetic, I just feel very drowsy and like, you know, alone and sleepy as well, because I feel like, if you're just going to like, because the environment is a major factor as well, when it comes to feeling lonely, if you, if you're in a room, which is dark, it's like, your natural like, like the way you think, the natural, naturally you’ll think ‘yeah, I'm alone’ and it's like kind of, kind of depressing, kind of way, because you’re alone away from like human contact, everything, so yeah. Hmm… and you mentioned something about depressive thoughts. Yeah, so I feel like, you would feel, that's when like you kind of reassess maybe your day and like you’ll just think about all the good things that happened and all the bad stuff and then kind of outweigh the bad stuff or the good and yeah, just, you’ll just feel even more bad about yourself and you’ll just feel kind of sad in a way and yeah it could make you feel very depressed, yes, sad. So, when you’re in your room and, you know, you said it's dark and you kind of assess your, your daily, how thing went in your daily life that doesn't bring, you’re saying that doesn’t bring good feelings No, I don’t think it brings good feelings, because most of the time like, you, when it’s like kind of, I feel like because naturally you'd contrast like light with good and happy, and then Darkness with like the negative side of things and I feel like for, in a day, it will be kind of the balance of having a good day or good, good moments and the bad moments, so I feel like in the day you would feel good, you would feel like the best feeling you can ever feel, and then at night time you just kind of reassess like, you know, you feel all the bad emotions and stuff and just because, because the balance is kind of a key factor when it comes to like emotions personally that's what I think. Okay, is there anything else you'd like to say? No, that’s it. Okay, thank you."
