"Interview 34 Parts 1 & 2 – Female, 19, Tower Hamlets Key: I:Interviewer R:Respondent I:So, can we start by talking about what you’ve put first? R: So, for example, if I’m lonely, I think about a lot of stuff, like I recently haven’t been feeling lonely but back in the days I have when I found it difficult to make friends and stuff, and so obviously I used to think to myself and feel really… unwanted. I feel really insecure as well. So obviously I used to think about negative stuff, but then at the same time I used to talk to certain people that used to make me feel… think positive, so obviously… Yeah. But the majority of it, I’m just like, used to sit down somewhere, some nice places and think: ‘Why am I like this? Why am I not like other people?’ and stuff like that. And the second is about… I:Oh no, no, sorry. Before you move on to the second one- R: Oh, OK. I:Yeah, I’m gonna ask you some questions. So basically, it sounds like what you’re saying is, sometimes you… think to yourself ‘Why am I like this’ or ‘Why am I not like this?’ R: Yeah. I: And… Can you tell me more about that? R: So… Well, it was recently, I’m all fine but obviously it’s all about how I used to feel. I: Sure. R: So, um… So I’m just like… Sometimes you just think like… I: How old are you by the way? Sorry if I’m interrupting. R: I’m eigh… nineteen. I: Yep. Sure. Sorry, go ahead with your… R:Yeah, so um… Sorry, what d’you want me to say? I: Cos you mentioned sometimes you feel that you… sometimes you feel that you don’t have… ‘Why do I not have that?’ or sometimes you feel like ‘Why does that happen to me?’ (overspeaking) R: Yeah because I- Oh. OK. So I used to see other people hanging around with a group of friends and I used to have one or two friends but I wanted that. You know, when I was little, more younger, that’s when I used to think that it’s nice, hanging around with other people doing lots of things, you know. And then I used to think to myself like, ‘Why?’. ‘Why am I… Why can’t I make more friends?’ Or maybe, I have a different personality, which is not matching with other people. That’s why they’re friends with… I: That’s why what, sorry? R: That’s why they’re friends with more people and not me. That’s what I used to think and feel. Yeah. I:So it sounds like what you’re saying is, sometimes you wish you had more friends, or sometimes you felt like, ‘why are some people hanging out with each other and they’re not spending time with me?’ R:Yeah. When I first, obviously, I first started from my primary to my secondary, so obviously at that time it was… Like getting to know each other kind of thing. Like getting to know other people around the class. So… yeah. It was difficult to make friends, ‘cos I used to be shy as well, at the same time. I don’t wanna- I didn’t want to express to people much. So yeah. I:And how did that make you feel when you saw everyone hanging out together and not being friends with you, and being…? R:Well obviously, then I used to try and talk to them, and… But then… They didn’t used to talk to me? But obviously I felt like I’m not wanted in the group. I:How did that make you feel, not being wanted? R:I felt… anxious. I felt lonely. I felt upset. I:So, sounds like sometimes you felt left out when you’re at school. R:Yeah. Yeah. I:And what does it say here? Is this a picture of you thinking, for example? R:Yeah, thinking. It’s just like, a random picture. I: And what does it say in it? So many things come…? R:Comes to my mind, negative and positive. I:So when you say ‘so many things, negative and positive’, can you tell me the negatives and the positives? R:Like negative, for example… Negative… Say for example. What, shall I just talk about the school times or other times…? I:Whatever you feel comfortable with. R:So I’m just like- (overspeaking) I:Or I guess you can just give me an overall summary of whatever you feel… R:Negatives like… ‘Why am I not like that person?’ or ‘Why am I different compared to other people?’ and ‘What can I do to make myself think…’ like, ‘make myself’… ‘How I can make myself like others’. That’s like, how I used to think. Yeah, like I wish ‘I wasn’t born’ kind of thing. But obviously I don’t wish that anymore, because back then… ‘Why am I here in this world?’ and… You know, if I feel like ‘I don’t have a life’, kind of thing. And positive is like- I:For the ones that are positive, lemme ask, ‘cos when you wish you didn’t have a life, or you felt like you didn’t have a life, can you tell me more about that? R:Like, you know, it’s just like… When you’re angry you just feel like ‘why am I in this world?’, you know… I don’t know how to explain more. I:When you said that you were, you felt like you were different compared to others. Tell me more about that. R:I should be more… I should be more funny with other people, maybe that’s why they don’t… I used to be so shy, that’s why maybe they didn’t want me. Or, I dunno, maybe I look ugly, why they don’t wanna talk to me, kind of things. I:So sounds like you felt different. R:Yeah. I:Compared to the majority of the… other… R:Yeah. I:… people within your own group. R:Yeah, yeah. I:And how did that make you feel being… feeling that you were different? R:I obviously, I see them and I try to be like them. I try more… socialising with other people, tried to be nice to them, you know, offer them if they want… If they in a class, offer them like sweets, chocolates, just to be close to them. Yeah. I:So sounds like you didn’t really feel good around them, or you didn’t feel… You felt like you didn’t fit in with them. R:Yeah. I:Because you were shy, or other things. R:Yeah. I was shy. I:And how did that make you feel when you felt like… you were shy? R:What if I… I was shy because, what if I say something and then it sounds wrong to them? That’s why I didn’t wanna speak. I:So sounds like you were a little worried, you know, what if they judge you? R:Yeah. I:What if you say something, and they don’t agree with it, or… How did you feel about that? R:I feel like I’m left out. And… That’s why maybe I couldn’t make friends back then, because I was shy the majority of that time. Didn’t talk about… I:And you mentioned also you had positive thoughts in your head, so many things comes to your mind, negative and positive. R:Yeah, so why I said positive is like, if I think in a positive way like… you know, my family’s there for me, if anything happens, you know, I can share with them and tell them, and in my family I have cousins and other people around me who can help me through it, so yeah. I can discuss it with them. I:So it sounds like what you’re saying is, even though you might have difficulties, like, you had a difficulty fitting in, you know you have a good system of support from your family and cousins and relatives. And how does it feel when you know that you have a family that you can rely on, that you have relatives to go to? R: Made me feel really happy, positive, and then, I feel like, there’s… Obviously I’m not lonely anymore if I do express them and they explain it to me: ‘Look, we’re there for you. If anything…’ you know, discuss it with… I feel like I’m wanted around my family and stuff. I feel really proud and happy. I:It sounds like you don’t feel left out with your family- R:No. I:They want you, they include you. R:Yep. I:Whereas sometimes you don’t necessarily feel the same with your friends. R:Yeah. Obviously, it’s like, back in the days things. I:And tell me about now, how about now? How are things, do you still feel the same way? R:No, I’m really happy. Since I did my studies, and then I went to got a job, and around my job place everyone’s really nice and I got to make more friends now, I’m living a healthy life. I feel really proud of myself that I got my education and then, top of that I have friends, family, everyone around me, I can go out with them anytime and have like party, you know like birthday party, any other parties, during my work place. I feel really positive and healthy. I:Is there anything else you’d like to say about that part? R:No. I:Thank you. Can we start by talking about what you put in the second box please? R:So, here I said I feel like I was someone else who’s living a healthy life. As I mentioned before as well, I wish I was like someone else, that’s who I wanted so… But I wrote it in a separate… I:Sure. R:And this one, the third one… I:Before we move on to the third box, would you be OK if we explore these a bit further? R:Yeah, you can ask me questions, go on. I:Thank you. So when you say that you wish you were somebody else… R:Like living a healthy life, basically. I:When you say ‘living a healthy life’, can you tell me about that? R:Living a healthy life, as in, having lots of friends around, like what I’m living right now. Having lots of friends around me, and going out more often, having fun, jokes around, and all sort of things. All sort of positive things. I:So sounds like, sometimes you wish that you were… you would live someone else’s life, as in, someone who would be a bit more popular… someone who would have more friends… R:But sometimes being too popular is not a good thing. Obviously they have other things going on, like living a healthy life. I:When you say sometimes not good to… Can you tell me more about that? R:If you be popular, a lot of people knows you, you have enemies, and, you know, people get jealous of you, and they can do things to you. Harm you, maybe. ‘Cos in the news I’ve seen people… For example, do you watch ‘Love Island’? I:No. R:Oh, OK. So ‘Love Island’ from last year, they were really popular. Then after, as soon as they got out they committed suicide and stuff. So sometimes it’s a negative by being too popular, but obviously you want friends who’s there for you, you can discuss anything with them, that kind of thing. I:So sounds like what you’re saying is, you want to have more friends, you want to have a more… social life, but at the same time, you want to have friends you can trust. You don’t want to just be popular and to have a sort of unhealthy lifestyle as in, not happy, people being jealous of you. You don’t like that. R:No, no. Not too popular, what I’m saying. Yep. I:And how do you feel about that? R:Feel about…? I:And how do you feel about… How do you feel when you want that but you don’t have that? When you want to be someone who’d be more sociable, who’d be more outgoing and so on, but you don’t have that. How does that make you feel? R:Make me think? Like, make me think how I can be like someone like that. What I can do to make myself like that sort of person… Anything else? I:When you say that, you don’t wanna be too popular because people can be jealous, can you tell me more about that? R:Some people will be like… Some people will go to other people and be like: ‘That person’s so popular, how did they get there?’ and then, try to create negative (unclear 0:16:31-0:16:32) with them, talk about negative… about them, like say ‘Oh this person’s that’, and they’re proper… you know, gossiping, kind of thing. That’s like all jealousy. I:So sounds like you don’t like that. You don’t want to be a part of that. You don’t want to be popular that people talk negatively about you. R:Yeah. I:And do you think that happens often within your circle of, within your friendships or within your age range? R:Right now? … Not… Not really. No. I:Is there anything else you want to say about that part? R:No, that’s it really. I: OK, thank you. Can we start talking about what you put in the third box, please? R:So obviously, when I’m lonely, I just feel like, why am I not like a kid? Kids have free problem, they have no problems like… I wish I was that. I was that child, I was that children. Because I work with children, sometimes if anything comes into my mind, I’m just like… I wish I had their life. And obviously I was at their age once, but… Ah well. You know, you’re just thinking, and you just think like… (unclear 0:18:23-0:18:24) Because you see, and especially you see other people, when you see other people… When you have a problem, and then you’re tryna sort that out and you’re really stressed and you see other people around you like, oh they’re really happy, look at them, like whereas I’m stressed, I’m doing this now, I’m doing that now, you know. But then at the same time I’m just like, that’s life, you know. Life is full of happiness and sadness, life is not always about being happy… Anything else? I:So it sounds like what you’re saying is… you sometimes wanna be a child because you feel that they’re have no problem to worry about. R:Yep. I:So it seems to me that you, that you sometimes feel, that you wish you didn’t have problems. Tell me more about that. R:My problem… What, as in, problem? I:Just in general, like, tell me more about ‘yeah, sometimes you wish you didn’t have problems’. Tell me more. R:Problems like… If I, for example… Like someone and I want to get married to that person and then, obviously everyone has to… within my family, everyone has to agree with it and kind of thing, and obviously have to… It’s a long process in our culture, especially like we have to make everyone happy to get married. So, telling them how the person’s like, it’s just stressful when they say about, ‘how d’you know that person’s gonna be living a healthy life with you?’ Because they worry about me, obviously, there are so many questions, and other people would be like ‘oh no, she’s getting matched with a person, he’s like this, he’s like that’, you know, ‘he must be’… ‘how do you know he’s gonna keep you happy?’ and things, and I’m just like that… After you explain them so much to make them trust me and… trust me, I’ll be happy with the person because I’ve known that person for a long time, so yeah, that kind of problem. I:So sounds like sometimes, having to explain things to your family about your personal choices can make you feel lonely. R:I’m not lonely, but… Feel stressed, like, OK, after you explain a lot what else should I do? But yeah, I’m getting there. I:You also mentioned that, when you see other people living happy lives, not having problems, and you use your life is different, can you tell me more about that? R:Or it’s maybe… People, they just do things indoors… Wait what did you say? I:No, it’s because you mentioned earlier on that you sometimes see other people kind of, not having problems and being happy, and you have some  problems and stuff that other people don’t have and stuff, and… Can you tell me more about them? R:For example, my friends, they’ll be like… They’re fine, they’ve been like… They don’t have complain to complain about, but as if I have some problems I just say, yeah, you know. And seeing them, like ‘I have no problems’, it’s like ‘Aw, I wish I was like you’. But obviously I don’t know what’s happening indoors, maybe they don’t wanna say what problems they have, or somethings, so… I:And how does that make you feel, seeing your friends not having problems, and not complaining and you (unclear 0:23:44-0:23:46) R:I mean, I feel happy for them, like they have that kind of life, but… Yeah, I just feel like, yeah. I can do things to make it better. Make my life better… Obviously like, not everyone has the same life. Everyone’s different, but they’ll be problem but it’s not like I’m gonna suffer with the same problem forever. Like, it’ll go one day, if you have problem. For example, back in the days I didn’t used to have any friends, but now I’ve got friends. It changes. I:So sounds like what you’re saying is, you, when you see your friends having things that you don’t have or doing things or not having… or not complaining about their life and you… It makes you think that, you have to do more, you have to fix somethings in your life. Can you tell me more about that? R:Fixing things as in… Like, more often think positive, thinking positive, and obviously, always because I see as such for coats, like coats online. I:Coats online? R:Yeah, coats, like, you know- I:Oh, ‘quotes’ online. Yeah. R:Quotes. Yeah, sorry. I:Sorry. R:Yeah, it’s fine. To see, like when I read those quotes, you feel… not happy, what makes you happy. Like think positive, so think positive, and stay around positive people to make you feel better. So yeah, that’s what I think. I:And when you say ‘think positive’, can you tell me more about that? R:Thinking positive… Like, obviously I’m earning but I’m obviously thinking, ‘oh, if I… soon, if I start saving up, soon I’ll be saving up a lot of money, I’ll be happy then, after. I can do lots of things, maybe I can go with my partner and if I can save a lot and buy a house that kind of thing, I can focus on that, (unclear 0:26:24-0:26:26). Anything else? I:So what you’re saying is, when you have to do things to make things… to fix things, you think of things in a more positive way and that means that, you think that you need to focus on work and earning more and thinking about what you might do when you earn more, so when you, if you think about ‘oh I need to save more money to buy my house, to travel more with my partner’ and so on, so you start to think positively in those ways. R:Yeah. Uh huh. I:So when you say, you think more positively, how does that impact your loneliness? R:Obviously, I don’t feel lonely any more if I think positive in that sort of way. Feel like, ‘you know what, life is full of negative and positive, if I’m thinking positive, then positive will come to me’. So yeah, I’ve started thinking positive stuff that I can do to make things better, feel more happy. Feel more happy, yeah, and… Anything else? I:So when you say that, if you think positively, more positive things will happen to you? Can you tell me more about that? Is it OK if you speak a little louder because of the background noise, I’m recording – R:Yeah, that’s fine. Sorry. I:Thank you. R:So… I:Do you want me to repeat the question? R:Yeah, please. I:Sure, if you want. Because, I’m just trying to reflect back what you’re saying, so you said when you think positively you will… positive things will happen to you, so like when you attract, when you think positively you attract them. Can you tell me more about that? R:Yeah like, I, obviously I see a lot of (unclear 0:28:58-0:29:00) and quotes, saying like… I think, and… Yeah, sometimes thinking positive gives (unclear 0:29:07-0:29:10) sometimes, like… I dunno how to explain it but… Like if you keep on thinking negative then you’re gonna be more lonely and more sad and like I say, but obviously if you wanna cheer yourself up then think about like going to a place, eating with your friend, expressing, having jokes around, like, make you forget about that things, and obviously like if you keep on thinking negative about negative stuff, then obviously you keep on thinking negative and it would like, destroy kind of, destroy your brain. As in, like you’ve thought more stress then more… More upset, kind of thing? So yeah… Anything else? I:Is there anything else you want to say? R:No. I:Thank you. Can you start by talking about what you put in the final box please? R:For like… Staying in my own place, with only me and my loved ones who is by my side always would be with me. So like… Like… I want to have, obviously I picture a house in my… my life. I had my own house, I would be with my partner and… Yeah. If… And obviously, I’d be around him all the time because he gives me positive vibes, when I’m like upset or if I’m thinking about something that is bothering me, he’s… He always makes me happy, you know? Give me that positive vibe. So staying with him in a place, in a house, I… I obviously like, when you’re married and stuff you want your own house anyways, so yeah. I:And how does that impact your loneliness? R:So… I won’t feel lonely because I know there’s someone with me who, even if I think negative or if I feel lonely about anything, like, he would be there for me to explain, you know, ‘that’s nothing’, let’s… ‘forget about it,’ you know, sort of thing. Explain it to me, why is good to… explain it to me, like why forgetting it makes me feel more better, if I like, for example, make a mistake. He’s there for me to support me (unclear 0:32:18-0:32:20) Anything else? I:So it sounds like what you’re saying is, basically to turn that the other way round, not having someone like your partner to talk to, to tell you that things would be OK. If you don’t have that, that can actually make you feel lonely. R:Yeah. So obviously I want positive vibes always, and obviously you would want someone to be a life partner who’s there for you, who’s making jokes, and obviously you wanna spend your whole entire life with someone who’s there for you, so yeah. Staying with him make me feel more happy. I:So having sort of a long-term partner… would be good in terms of reducing your loneliness. R:Yeah. I:How does that make you feel? R:Feel happy, feel so much better. Make me think positive. Make me forget the loneliness. And make me stress free as well. I:So it sounds like what you’re saying is, when you’re around your partner you don’t tend to think as much about negativity or pretend to not worry so much about stress and things like that. R:Yep. I:What is it about your partner, or a partner, that can reduce feelings of loneliness? R:Sorry? I:What is it about having a partner that can actually prevent you from feeling lonely? R:Because you’re always… You’re always in life, you need a partner who can be there for you and you can discuss anything without worrying, so… That’s why it’s important to have your partner… who cares for you, who loves you, and who’s there for you. I:So you’re saying that, having someone to talk to, having someone who cares about you, having someone that loves you can make you feel less lonely. R:Yep. Definitely. I:And you said here, ‘I feel like sometimes in my own place, where only me and…’ R:Where? … I:Where? ‘On my-‘ R:‘On my place, where only me and my…’ Sorry, my handwriting’s bad. I:No, don’t worry, no. R:‘… with my…’ I:‘… with your loved ones by your side’. R:Just specifically I’m talking about my mum. (unclear 0:36:02-0:36:04) I:And you feel like you want to do that, and having a place with you and your husband… R:Yeah. Where no one will bother me. Where you can be only me and him around. So there’s not other people who can… There’s not other (unclear 0:36:32-0:36:34) A new place, starting a new, new life. There’s obviously, everyone knows this guy, my family when they grown up. I:And when you say… not being around negative people, dealing with negativity, can you tell me more about that? R:Sorry? I:When you said you wanna be with your husband, just you and him, so you’re not around other people with negativity, can you tell me more about that? R:Like people as in… I:Do you mind speaking a little louder- R:Oh sorry. I:No, don’t worry. R:No people as in… People that gives you negative vibe, like say… Make you feel low, like saying ‘ah you can’t do this, you can’t do that’, making me feel like I can’t do things, making me feel like the person I like… For example, some people will say ‘are you sure about… getting married to that person, staying with that person’… Make me think about… Am I sure? But then I know I’m sure about him. But yeah, I don’t like people who’s like… Talking, talking to me like that, and making me feel like I’m not making the right decision. I:Sounds like… People who might get in your way, or like, challenge you on like… can make you feel lonely? R:Yeah… I:And how does it feel now, that you’re not with your husband, just you and him? R:Me and…? I:How does it feel now, that you and your husband are not actually in one place, just you and him alone? Is there any space for you to express that, you would feel less lonely when you’re with your husband, by his side, by his side? And I take it that you’re not with him like, in one place, you haven’t moved together yet, so… How does it feel, now? R:I feel like… Being with him more often, make me feel better, but obviously, with us I personally want to move out before getting married because that’s like… Because I’m Muslim, we… We don’t do things before getting married, kind of thing, so yeah. But it’s like getting married, being together, make me think really like… positive and make me feel happier. I:Is there anything else you want to say? R:No. PART 2 I:Thank you. Now we move on to the second task. R:Yep. I:So… This is just about basically choosing the place in your neighbourhood where you feel most socially connected and also place where you feel most lonely. Can we start by talking about what you put in box one where you find the place where you actually most socially connected? R:I feel great when I’m around friends who cares about me and listens to me. So like… Socialising with my friends, certain friends who cares about me, like, make me feel like I’m wanted and then, make me feel like I can be myself around them like, I can do whatever, you know. Just be myself, like they won’t care they won’t judge me or anything, saying… Make me feel great. I:So sounds like what you’re saying is, you feel more socially connected when you’re actually around your friends, especially those who care about you, who don’t judge you, you can be completely yourself around them… R:Yep. I:And how does that make you feel when you’re around them? R:They make me feel really happy, I feel better… I like being around them. I:Hmm? R:Yeah. I like being around them. I:And what did you write here? Is it OK if you read them? R:All of them? Yeah. I:Yes, please. R:‘I feel…’ This is the first one. ‘I feel great when I’m around my friend, around my friends who cares about me and listens to me, and I feel connected when I’m in a party where I’m having lots of fun with my friends, like party as in birthday party, like celebrating something, casual things kind of party. I feel connected with people who listens to me. I like going to open places, like seaside, where I can get fresh air from… with my loved ones. My family, friends…’ I:Just before we move on, when you say that you feel more socially connected around people or friends who actually listen to you, can you tell more about that, when you say ‘listen’? R:Listen so… For example, listening as in… If I say, ‘oh come, let’s do this’, ‘oh come, let’s do that’, kind of thing, and listening… Other things you can’t have any problems and I can discuss it with them and they tell me ‘you know what, don’t worry about it, pray and always be positive, and, you know, we’re there for you, so if you need anything I would hope that…’ that makes me feel really happy. Make me think like, ‘yes, I can rely on them’, kind of things. I:So you’re saying that having a good system of friends, network, where you feel like you can rely on them, where you feel like you can talk to them, they’ll listen to you, they’ll give you advice, can actually make you feel more socially connected. R:Mmh-hmm. I:Is there anything else you want to say about that box? R:Um… No. I:You mentioned some… ‘Seaside’, right? R:Oh, places. Yeah. So if I go to places with my friends like… Seaside, where I can get fresh air from, it’s nice, and especially during summer and all of us really like… Hot, feels nice. Going to explore the water and just like… sitting by the sun, make me feel proud and make me feel… Much better, having fresh air, then in new places. Especially I like water. I:You like what? R:Water. Like seaside, in the swimming pool… Especially when it’s hot, you want to have bath with cold water and you wanna feel cold water, so yeah. I like places, open places. I:Are there any seaside in your neighbourhood? R:No, it’s kind of far. It’s really… Yeah. I:Shall we move on to the next one? So, can you start by talking about what you put in box two please? R:‘I feel lonely if I stay in my house for too long’, so whereas I’m… obviously I’m like working full time, so I don’t like staying at home that long. I like doing other things. And if I stay at home then, and if I don’t have anything to do, then I’ll watch films and I’ll feel like I’m really bored and… you know, I don’t have anything to do. But if I make myself busy with things then, I can get through it, through the day. But if I stay at home… I:Sounds like your home is actually where you feel most lonely. T R:No, if I stay at home for too long then… Yeah but obviously, talking to… I talk to my brothers, sisters, you know, my nieces and stuff when they come over, it’s nice. But obviously, when… If it’s just me, doing my work and, you know, I have nothing else to do in the house… Then yeah, I feel bored but at the same time I have… social media, I go on there and on Instagram, I see (unclear 0:46:55-0:46:56), I listen to music, I listen to… I watch films, I listen to the songs that I like… I do that. But obviously like, if you do the same thing over and over again then, you feel… Bored. I:So you associate boredom with loneliness. R:Why I feel lonely? I:No, I’m just trying to reflect what you’re saying is that… It seems to me that you’re associating being bored to feeling lonely, so when you find yourself bored, that’s when you feel lonely. R:Yeah. Like just putting it in that way, yeah. I:So when usually no one is around and you have no work to do, when you’re at home alone, that’s when you’re gonna feel like, alone and lonely. When your brothers and sisters are not home with you, your nieces and nephews… You mentioned social media. Can you tell me more about that? You use social media to prevent you from feeling lonely? R:Yeah… [yawns] Excuse me. I:Sorry? R:Talk to my friends on WhatsApp and… and on Snapchat, and on Instagram, I see like people’s story, I see a lot of people’s story, that’s how I… my time goes. I read quotes. I like songs, music that comes up on the news feed… see those… and I’ve (unclear 0:49:07-0:49:09) see news coming up, what’s going on around the world, I read them. I’m really interested in them. I:And how does that make you feel when you see your story or your friends on social media when you see people’s stories? R:Yeah, it’s nice seeing what they’re doing and stuff. If they go to places on their holiday and they put it up I see like… The new places and then… Obviously I just think to myself ‘maybe I can go to that place one day’, if I don’t like it I’ll just be like ‘no that’s not my kind of thing’. Then obviously I see the pictures and… Stuff. I:And you also mentioned watching movies at home. R:Yeah. I:When you’re bored, you end up watching movies. R:Yeah. I:Is that… Can you tell me more about that? R:So I watch… Sometimes niche films about more into Indian films. I like Hindi films like romantic films, and films like Prime films, where it’s really interesting to watch, is… It’s (unclear 0:50:33-0:50:35) film, I really like it, it’s interesting. I like… You don’t know what’s gonna happen in the film, then you find out it’s shocking, kind of films. I like those. I:And you also mentioned listening to music. You listen to music when you feel lonely or do you listen to music… whenever? R:Yeah… If I miss someone, like my partner, I listen to music, makes me feel better, and in general if I’m bored then I listen to music as well. I:So sounds like what you’re saying is you feel lonely at home when people aren’t around and you’ve got things to do, work at school, at work and things, but then you kind of keep yourself busy by watching a movie, listening to music, go on social media… R:Yeah. I:And how does that make you feel going on technology? R:It make me… Make me feel good. Make me feel better… My time goes more faster if I do that. I:When you say your time goes faster, can you tell me more about that? R:If I’m bored, if I’m on my social media or watching films, the film is like one hour long or sometimes three hours, two hours… I:Can we read what you wrote down here? R:Yep. ‘So I feel lonely if I stay in my house too long, I felt lonely when I… when people make me feel like I’m not wanted. I feel lonely in my college if I don’t understand anything, like if I don’t understand some sort of question and then after… I’m more don’t know what to do, I need to get my work done, so… I’m being an issue at the moment because I do go college, and I do… I’m working full time… And I’ve got lectures twice in a month. I:You’ve got what sorry? R:College twice in a month. Finish my… coursework and stuff. So yeah, if I don’t understand something, I do ask questions [yawns]. I don’t like asking too many times, if I annoy someone, then, might… I:So if you don’t understand something, and if you… You might feel like you’re asking them too many questions, do you just avoid asking questions and that can make you feel a bit sad or lonely? R:Yeah. I:Sounds like you don’t want to… You avoid asking questions because you don’t wanna be judged. You worry about what others might think of you. R:They might feel like, ‘I’m stupid, I don’t know, what am I doing’. So then at the back, at the same time I do get it. I do understand what I’m doing, but I do lots of research and… (unclear 0:54:19-0:54:20) if I asked my friend she helps me (unclear 0:54:23-0:54:25) I:You also mentioned that you feel unwanted when you… Can you tell me more about that? Do you feel most lonely when you feel unwanted? R:Yeah, I was saying like back in the days, when I felt unwanted, I felt lonely. I mentioned that. I:Yeah, you mentioned that, yeah. Thank you. R:That’s alright. I:Is there anything else you want to say? R:No. I:OK, thank you very much. R:That’s alright."
