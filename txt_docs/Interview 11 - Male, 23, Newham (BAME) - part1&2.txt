Thank you.  In relation of portraying thoughts about feeling lonely is, this first image is like a dot, that's all the way in the corner, like a full stop and then everything else is like, far away from what? The full stop is trying to, it's like everything is like distance, so that's how like it portrays the loneliness, the lonely feeling and this one is like a drawing. Sorry before we move on, can you tell me more about that? So, you're saying that there's a black dot and then there's everything else so far from it?  Yeah.  Can you tell me more about that?  I feel like it's kind of like showing that this is, this is the world and this is how you're seen, as like a black person, like a black dot. Okay, tell me more about that black dot.  It's like people don't relate you to a normal human, you're kind of categorized, but yeah, that's how I see it, then this... *gets interrupted*  Sorry, I'm just gonna ask you some questions about the first one. So, who, is that a specific person or is that... No, that's, that's just how I see, I think of the overall like depiction of loneliness, do you know what I mean? If we're talking about people... yeah. How does that make you feel?   This makes me feel is a, is, as you look at it, I look at the image straight away and it's like 'what's this', do you know what I mean? This makes, this is outstanding from everything else, but then, it's still on its own over here and everything else is, there's more going on here. So, this is in a way more easier to kind of describe I mean, this is way... I'm sorry, this is way more easier to describe and this is a bit harder because there's a lot going on, this is way easier to describe, it's just a dot, that's just there.  So, tell me when you said 'there's a lot going on over there', can you tell me more about that? Yes, so that could be everything, all the world's problems, like there's a lot going on right now, like that could be everything and it's like, there's so much going on where people,  people don't know what to do because there's so much going on, that's why there's so many dots and stuff like that, because there's a lot going on and it's harder for like, you see how they, you could put this in anyone, it's a, this could even be someone else, someone else running the whole country and is looking at it from this point of view and people don't see it from that point of view, it's like, yeah, that's why I feel like there's a lot of problems in the world because you have one kind of person like, basically, that's meant to have this big role to like look after your country and it's like the only way your country would work, if all of these people here, like, do you know what I mean? One-by-one do what he's doing as well, within the communities, like not just one person, it's like, it would never work like that, that's why it's loneliness, yeah *laughs* So you're saying that, there's that one person, the black dot in one person doing everything and that person is alone.  Yeah.  Okay, tell me more about that.  So, it's like, when you have a lot of people relying on you, it's like you're on your own kind of thing, it's like you have a lot to rely on, in terms of like, even like parents and stuff like I didn't understand what my parents were going through until I started living alone. So so you start realizing things. And so you're like okay. I understand why people act a certain way sometimes why people like someone's upset or angry like. like more than I would because it's like there's less to worry about you get, it's like when you have less to worry about your attitude towards things (min 04:20) do you know what I mean? It's like that. So, you're saying that if you have less worries your attitude to life is different.  Yeah. And if you have more worries and that makes you feel, how does that make you feel?  It makes you feel like you, you can't be heard, because it's like, even if you're screaming or shouting, it's like being in space, it's like there's so, we are in space, but then it's like being in space on your own, it's like you're trying to do stuff, but then it's like you're here, but you can't and it's like ok, like, then you start developing like feelings and stuff like that. That's what the brain does it's like, t's like everything we see is what we create and it's like when you're trying, you brain is trying to create a reality and it's like you're stuck in a certain reality, it's like you start having this ease of like, of life, it's like, it's a lot to do with medical stuff as well, so a lot of people have diseases in low-income areas and stuff like that, it's not, it's not by chance or like it's, it works from the mind first, do you know what I mean? The only way your body works is from the mind, we already know that, so why is there like *laughs* do you know what I mean? Why is there so much of confusion of like why are things going on? It's like we focus on the mind first and then everything else, do you know what I mean?  So, you're saying that, um, basically not, so, others not understanding you, you, just being misunderstood, you know, leads to loneliness.  Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.  Tell me more about that.  Because even like, I grew up in, in like poverty areas that it's like, I feel like I've had this, I've had this sense of like knowledge, is like, to receive knowledge, I want to get more knowledge and stuff like that, I don't want to just think one way, but then it's like I've lived in places where people think one way and in society. So, then you realize why you have like certain problems and stuff like that, because, so all that you think about, it's like when you start introducing that type of like, forms of thinking, whatever to people and it's like, they are like 'what are you talking about?' It's because they haven't been educated, it's like education, it's like key, it's like that's very important and it's like a lot of people don't want to be taught in these areas, because they've already, kind of like, seen their life already, do you know what I mean? It works through everything, through media, everything, people already see everything, it's like the TV is like, I feel like, it's like a crystal ball, the, the television, you know that? I feel like the television, the Internet it's like crystal ball, you can see everything in full, do you know what I mean? It's like, I wouldn't know what Jamaica looks like, or New York looks like, if there wasn't any television or photos, do you know what I mean? That's my idea, my idea is like, it's like a very important thing we have, like technology, piece of technology we have is like a crystal ball, do you know what I mean? It's like, It's amazing.   So... sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you, what did you want to say? No, that's it, that's all. Okay, so, um, so, basically, the crystal um, like technology, TV, mobile phone and so on, um you say they're amazing, tell me more about that.  They're amazing because it's allowed humans to transfer information faster than we ever had, do you know what I mean? It's like, if you're looking back a hundred years ago, there wasn't any source of telecommunication and it's like, now that we have that, it's like we're kind of in a state of emergency, because there's so much information and it's like information changes thinking of, about the world, do you know what I mean? If the whole world knows a piece of information it changes a mass amount of people and thought and it's like that's the, do you know what I mean? There's cons and there's pros, as well, to all of this, so it's like that's why I don't hate, that's why, you can't hate, you can't love, it's like everything that's been done it's like, it's done for good purpose and bad purpose as well, do you know what I mean? And it's like, once you understand that you start realizing and it's like 'Wha-, wha-, why, why is everyone into all of this stuff, like growing up and stuff like that?'. Like I remember I was into, like being black here, you'd think 'Oh, you'd have to be like a gangster or something or like', do you know what I mean? Kind of saying fuck you to like society and like the government, kind of mentality, being black and then it's like I start realizing as I educate myself that I'm just my, I'm, I'm, I'm only human and it's ugh, I can't, do you know what I mean, I can't think about what's going on around me too much to influence my life and my, my destiny and that's what and I feel like technology's made a lot of like teenagers like be very proud with their thinking, as well and like, do you know what I mean? And thinking causes action, do you know what I mean? And it's like, that's another problem, do you know what I mean? And it's like, if there's more type of stuff, like that is changing thought on TV, and we could have a change in the world like the next 50 years, do you know what I mean? It's like, that's what I'm trying to do, anyway, yeah... it's like, we could have some sort of change, it's like that's the best way, you can't, humans don't like listen like, within like person to person anymore, that's over, because we have one of this, why do I want to meet up with you, when I can just FaceTime you, kind of thing, again that's the mentality we have nowadays, it's like, well I'm, I'm a bit older than the younger generation, because I'm around like my nephews and stuff like, my nieces, and I kind of understand like everything, it's like, okay when I was growing up I didn't have all this stuff, so my type of thinking is different from yours, it's like you're used to having something like, do you know what I mean? Like a phone or something, it's like I could go days without a phone, but it wouldn't be good for business, but you know what I mean? It's like I wouldn't have any actual com-, bad conscious over it, like I would just carry on with my life, if those are, no more phones like, do you know what I mean? But, it's for kids, no more phones would be like maaad, mad *laughs* for them, no more phones like, it would be like crazy, like you've seen the Simpsons, innit? They had a film when it's like, they were stuck in a glove and everyone's just like, everyone's realized that they were in this all this time and it's like 'Wow, it's like, we was always in it', it's like once you, you understand something it's like your brain changes overnight, it's like, it's odd. Thank you, okay a couple things, um so you mentioned that two things that there's a, um, okay, so, you said that teenagers these days have to actually watch out their actions, you said that they, they should yeah, watch their actions, can you tell me more about that?  I'd say like, you gotta like be more aware of like what you're doing, because it's like, everything you do when you're young, it's like, kind of outweighs itself from when, from now until, whatever you do now, from the next, from now until the next ten years, when I'm thirty, I'll have to like make some, a lot of big life decisions right now, that's gonna like make my future better and it's like a lot of people don't realize that and that's what, that's how we fell as a society, because it's like, we're not encouraging that, do you know what I mean, anymore, it's just like whatever is happening is happening, like, type of thing, do you know what I mean? So, can you, can you elaborate on that a little bit? Kind of like, what I'm saying it's like... there should be, I feel like there should be more stuff that kind of, because they say all the money that we are putting into and stuff like, is going towards this stuff, but even though I live in London, it's not my city or anything, it's like, some people growing up have to do stuff in like, living in these type of places is not, it's not a good place, you know what I mean, to live in. It's like I see people doing stuff that I don't understand, like you might, you might rob someone, stab someone and so you're, you're gonna go to prison for 10 years, 7 years and it's like you've wasted that whole of like, you've wasted like your life, like for a piece of action that could have been stopped by you just being educated or wanting to get, wanting to be educated, do you know what I mean? Seeing things that want, want you to be educated, do you know what I mean?  You mentioned that education is, basically people are avoiding education.  Yeah, basically yeah, because we have everything in our hands.  How does that make you feel?  It makes me feel like human civilization is... fucked, basically, yeah *laughs* like fucked, like it's so fucked, like it just makes me feel like yeah, we're fucked, it's like someone has to do something, do you know what I mean? It's like, like there always has to be... do you know what I mean? Someone that's gonna, like take the risk, do you know what I mean? Like, definitely.  So, people don't want education, um, what... so, you're saying that basically people these days don't want to yeah, educate themselves on certain topics because technology is very much available.  Yeah.   Okay, um, and um, and tell me more about, tell me more about how that impacts loneliness. Mmh, I'd say, for instance, it's like social media and stuff would like make you look at things like 'wow, I'm not doing anything', I'm looking at all these people like doing stuff, like, and I'm not doing anything, I'm just here, you know, thinking 'wow, am I even...', do you know what I mean? I just wasted, I wasted my time doing what I'm doing, kind of thing, I felt like that a few times when I started doing photography and stuff, it was like I look at other photographers and feel like 'oh, wh-, they're already doing everything', it's like, 'why am I doing this? If there are all these people already doing stuff it's like, it doesn't really matter', but I'm thinking that if I was a photographer like in eight, nine years or something, but there wasn't any Instagram or Facebook, then it's like, it all, it will be kind of easier because it's like a lot of people won't be able, don't see that type of art everywhere, so it'd be like yeah, you're, this is something new and amazing, it's like, because we've never seen anything like this, but nowadays it's like I've seen this already like on Instagram, I don't really appreciate that shit no more, because you've already seen it, it's like you've seen a lot of it that makes you not appreciate art as well as much because this is everywhere, you know, it's like on TV, like photos, it's like, it's nothing, it's becoming like it's nothing, it's like, do you know what I mean? It's like technology is fairly new, but it's, we're getting adjusted to it already, so quick. Mmh, so seeing other people, for example, doing photography makes you feel like you're wasting your time.  Yeah.  Tell me more about that.  Because it's like, you think, you think you're gonna get to this stage and it's like and you start thinking about all the other stuff you need to like sort out, like bills, all the stuff that kind of makes you feel like 'Why am I even doing this?' I could just do a normal job or just go back to University and study like, do you know what I mean? Because I was studying science before, Biomedical Science, and I was just like, I want to do the art thing because I'm really good at this right now, like I want to take the risk, I want to take the risk and just do it, because I could just go back to Uni anytime, really, like, do you know what I mean? And I was like, let me do this and it's like, after a while you start thinking 'I've been doing this for a while, but I haven't really built like um, a source, a big source of income from it, so it's just like you want to be ensured, like, do you know what I mean? It's like I want to be ensured on what I'm doing, otherwise, you're just always going to be like anxious, do you know what I mean? About, every day is like, do you know what I mean? Is this, am I wasting my time and stuff? And it's like. And when you see others, for example, other photographers on social media, how does that make you feel? It makes me... I like, I like the art, so I like it, you know, this is amazing and stuff like that, but it's also like a lot of people are just doing stuff, just because, they just want to look cool and it's like they don't actually have a general purpose, it's like, every artist I talk to or I've been working with, I've worked with like a big photographer or something like that, like so many people I meet in the industry are like, they are doing this for a sense of purpose, it's like, it's not just furs, colours and it's like, this is purposeful, that's why people love it so much, what people like, I don't know if you've heard of Richard Avedon, all these people like um... Jean-Paul Gaude, like all these people do it for a purpose, it's not just, not just making collages, they like, they mean something, that's why people love it because it's really, it's like people, you see something, it's like, you look at the Mona Lisa and you're like 'whaa-', do you know what I mean? It's like this is so good, because it was for a purpose, it wasn't just a drawing, like 'yeah, let me just do this to look cool', like yeah, there's a different thought process to it and nowadays people just do things because it's like, I need to look like I'm doing something on, on Instagram, otherwise I'm just a nobody, that's another form of loneliness, do you know what I mean? It's like you feel like you're not like these people because it's like you just need to do something that, do you know what I mean? That can make you look like you could fit in and stuff like that, I feel like people feel like that as well, like for sure, like that's another perception of loneliness because that's an outcast, do you know what I mean? Or through social media, that's something the internet has created, we've never had that before, do you know what I mean? That puts another bit of pressure on the world, again, and it's like *laughs* um.  You've also mentioned that people try to fit in and in social media... So much, yeah.  Tell me more *gets interrupted* Because you see people like kill themselves and shit, like over like social media, like, people getting bullied, like people getting, people like getting death threats, like celebrities get death threats and that's wild like, it's like, that's, social media has allowed that, do you know what I mean? For people to get, these are just normal people as well and it's like people don't even think like that, because you're so used to seeing them and in theory it's like, you could treat them however you want, because that's your entertainment, I feel like that's what people feel like of that, as well, and it's like, that's so bad, like, do you know what I mean? Like comedy or not, you can't be mes-, sending people death threats, like you must be crazy like to be doing that already because it's like that's what this has created for you like, do you know what I mean? You're stuck in a world where this is like a significant thing in your world, it's like that's what internet has created as well, social media for sure. Like, it's like people are stuck in like a small world and stuff like that and I see it and it's like 'wow', like, because it's like, being a photographer, it's like, you're like an owl, like you see everything, like I feel like you, you see everything from like this way, because it's like, all the ideas, I get everything, it's like I have to be around, like all these fashion parties and stuff like that and I see people and it's like, there's a lot going on in the world, like, it's like, there's a lot going on in people's like mental and stuff like, and it's like, I don't want to say it, because then people just think that I'm crazy and that's, do you know what I mean? Like, it's just like knowing yourself could help so much like real, like you wouldn't need any other stuff, like it doesn't, it's not connected to you, like, yeah. Um, so uh, you mentioned also something about fitting in, people trying to fit in on social media, can you tell me a little more about that?  For like fitting in people do so many things to fit in, they would do anything, like I see people like changing sex preferences from like being like straight to gay or gay people trying to be straight, it's like, it's like, it's like, you know, it's like, because I've seen you change from here, then a year later you're this and then you're this and it's like you're trying to fit into like social groups that are not for you, like, and it's like that's just going to create like... stress, like you're just gonna stress yourself, like to do that it's just like well, I mean you get people who are trying to dress a certain way or trying to act a certain way, trying to be a shit person, like from the, people are trying to act like different or something, and it's like, I grew up here and it's like, I grew up in these type of places and like I would hate to like, to be like them, try to be like that, it's like 'why would you want to try act like that?' and it's like people don't ever want to act like that. I know people that, that have gone to prison and stuff and all that stuff it's like, they don't, they don't like it, like they don't like it, they'll tell, they'll tell you, whoever tells you they like it, it's like psycho, like no one likes stuff, it's like when you grow up in certain places it's like you don't understand until your dad, someone is saying to you, like it's not me telling you about your study, how can I tell you about something you've made, like something you're doing? You're around, you don't, I don't know why you're doing this, do you know what I mean? Only you know and it's like, it's hard to like express that to someone like that is not used to doing that, do you know what I mean? It's like, it's, you're not gonna get it, it's like, if you're living here, people don't, people don't understand that. I've been going, going on to parties in West London and it's like *pause* these people's like topic of conversation is like, it's so crazy, it's like, they live in a world where is so different from here, like, I'd talk to someone here and it's like, it's different, it's like energy levels is different, it's like 'wow', like, it's like people really live in like different, like, it's like 'wow', and like no one cares like about anyone, and that's, that's a problem, like people really, really live in a narcissistic world, like what social media has done, like there's so many like people online and like, all these influencers or so-called, they're like narcissistic, it's like, it's so bad, it's visible, like it's so bad and that's like really bad, like, to be like that it's like you lose, you become heartless basically, you have to become heartless, it's like, do you know what I mean? Heartless? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like 'wow'. How does that make you feel? It makes me feel, it's so sad, I feel sorry for like people, because it's like, you feel like you need to be conform-, confirmed by everyone like, if you need to feel good, which is bad, like humans shouldn't feel like that, do you know what I mean? It's like, you should feel good within yourself, like you don't need anyone to tell you anything, do you know what I mean? Otherwise, you'll always gonna start being addicted to drugs, like people are addicted to heroin and stuff like that, need that dopamine, do you know what I mean? It's like to make them feel good, otherwise they can't like do anything, like they can't act normal, it's like wild, it's like that's another kind of job, as well, it's like, do you know what I mean? I feel it's like, if like a celebrity right now, like I don't know, Kim Kardashian or something, lost their Instagram account, like she'll go into depression, like, it's like, do you know what I mean? That would happen, it's like that's her life, like her whole basis is around that, like, it's like crazy, you know. Thank you, do you want to say anything else about that? No, that's good. Okay, cool, can we talk about what you've put in the second box, please? Okay, in the second box, it's like the word 'underdog' and this dog underneath, like a stick man, it's like a simple drawing, and it's like you're underneath like everything else, that's like the underdog is being lonely as well, mh. Can you tell me more about that?  It's like, it's kind of like being, being noticed, but unnoticed at the same time, yeah. Being noticed, but unnoticed, it's like, kind of like being ignored like, do you know the dogs, ignored, do you know what I mean? It's like dogs are used to going out and stuff, and this, this is just ignored and it's just like, do you know what I mean? It's like it doesn't know how to feel *laughs*, like yeah. How does that make you feel? Um... *pause* I don't know, don't know, I can't even think of anything, just that really, it's like being noticed, but unnoticed at the same time, that's what I can think of right now. Mh? That's what I can think of right now. So, so you're saying that you associate loneliness with being noticed, but being unnoticed? So, for example, seeing some, someone might be seen by some people, but in reality, they're not actually being seen. Yeah. They're not cared for, tell me more about that? I feel like, people could only care for you, care about you, for, for a certain things and it's like then, when you're not doing those things, they don't care about you anymore, because usually like old dog, that's like, the one that's being uncared for, because it's been, maybe these days like and this is like uncared for now, yeah, like that. So *coughs*, so, when you're saying 'old dog', what does that... can you tell me more about that? It's like a term, innit? Like the old, it's like the old dog, it's like we've used you and now we don't need to use, use, use it anymore or like, use it until your full, like full of possibility, do you what I mean? Like, this is how I feel. So, if you like, so like if we've used you, but we don't need to anymore, we put you aside, basically, we don't need you, that's it, we move on to the next one.  Yeah, yeah.  Tell me, tell me about that.  I feel like that, that's the most, I feel like that's what like most, it's like, when I first started working, I feel like I was being used a lot, because I was young, when I started doing this, I started taking photos when I was like 16, up until now, I'm 23 now, so it's almost 10 years, like, do you know what I mean? It's like, I've been doing it for a while, it's like I've seen so much and I've like, I've only started realizing now like then, a few times I've been used, do you know what I mean? It's like, people make money of like certain stuff, I didn't know that, I only know that now, because I've, I've done my education *laughs*, like do you know what I mean? I've researched, I've done my education, I've read books, like I know like how business works like, so this is like, it's like I feel like I'm starting again right now, like kind of thing *voice recording stops* But I’m better, I’m really good now. But I’m starting again. Yeah, I think I’m getting better at what I’m doing and I’m at a level that I know what I’m doing, it’s like, it makes more sense, I feel happier than I was before even though I might have been making better money, it wasn’t that much but now that I’m even though I’m kind of broke, I’m still working, it’s like I’m worth more now, and it’s like I’m better than I was before kind of thing. And it’s like that’s what gives me happiness, I know in my mind I know what I’m doing, it’s like, before then I didn’t know what I was doing, and it’s like, it was kind of cool but no, you should know what you’re getting into and what you’re doing especially when it comes to your career, like, for sure. If you wanted it to be everlasting, right? As long as you know what you’re doing, it’s like, you know what I mean? No one can really no one can stop that. Yeah. So basically you’re saying that being taken advantage of, being abused makes you lonely? Yeah, not abused, kind of like, just not, it’s like being used to do stuff, like (31:36 – something issues) for issues the what? You’re not getting paid enough or something, do you know what I mean, you should be getting. That’s what I feel like. And then like you’re not, those people are not talking to you to do stuff anymore cause they’ve already used you, you know, for what they needed to do to make their, do you know what I mean? To keep them happy, for that moment, you know what I mean? Yeah. How does that make you feel? It makes feel happy like cause I feel like I know like, now I’m more aware of things, like definitely, like it’s not the same as it was when I was like 18 doing (what? - 32:17). I’m way more aware of stuff. No I meant  before so people took advantage of you, didn’t pay you and stuff enough. I feel, I feel fine, cause I feel like what made me keep going was, I just loved doing it, so it’s just like, I love doing it so I’m just thinking in my head, this is what I like doing anyway I’d do this for free if I could but I meant to be getting paid, you get paid for this like do you what I mean? It’s like this is what I’m trying to live off, do you get it? It’s not a hobby even though I like doing it it’s not hobby, so I should be getting paid for it, do you know what I mean? Uhum. Okay. Can you tell me more about when you said people see you but then people don’t see you? How does that impact loneliness? It’s like being seen then [OR than] not seeing after and it’s like you kind of I feel like why was one, it’s like you feel like you’re probably doing something wrong basically, you’re either doing something wrong if you know what I mean? That’s why you can only think about, do you know what I mean? Like you must be doing something wrong if you’re not being seen? Do you know what I mean? Doing something but then it’s like you follow, you’re not doing it the right way, is there something? But you don’t know what that is, yeah. And does that make you feel? Don’t know. I’m not gonna tell you right now. I can’t really think of a feeling, like, I don’t really care cause I think, it’s like, whatever, yea. Um, yea, so, so when people for example, don’t really care and if people are not really getting full attention, if people are not really being authentic to you or they just wanna get what they want out of you, that kind of makes you feel lonely in a way, it makes you feel a bit like why are they doing this to me, what’s happening? And you start to question yourself, right? Yeah, that’s it. You feel like, I must be doing something wrong. Like, kind of thing, yeah. So it seems to me that you’re saying that you care about what others think of you. Yeah. Tell me more about that? I used to, not anymore. I used to care a lot what people think about me, stuff like that, and my work. And then that’s why I used to do a certain type of work cause you start, you care too much, it’s like now I don’t care and it’s like people like me more, now. Like, they love my work now, it’s like I’m seen as a different type of person now cause I’m just doing whatever I want to do, like my, I  paint sometimes, and take photos, I just do whatever I wanna do, doesn’t matter, I’m not thinking about anyone, I’m just thinking about what I want to do like, so if I wanna do a fashion shoot, if I wanna do documentary, anything, I’m just gonna do it, do you know what I mean? It’s like everyone’s different, everyone has a different story, you can’t think about other people when you’re doing your own thing, like, that kind of relates back to this. This? You mean the circle in the first box? Yeah. The little grey circle. Yeah. How does it make you… Cause it’s like everything is happening over here and you’re here [referring to the box] but at the beginning I was in here as well but now I’ve gone out there, and now I’m a producer, I produce… You’re in the sort of in the bigger box where you were, everyone was there? Like, everyone’s here watching TV, watching football, I was part of this people, now I realise that’s not, my way of thinking is not like, it’s like I’m basically like kind of restricted myself from like, for reaching a high level, I need to get a lot work [laughing]. I’m reaching, I’m, I need to,  like I could myself from so many positions to reach a high level and I’m just like trying to like sell for (Guess type? 37:20) when there’s way more to discover in the world, I just live in one little bit like there’s way more to discover, why would I wanna stop there? It’s like that’s what I feel like. Thank you. Is there anything else you want to say about that? No. Okay can we talk about what you put in box 3, please? The 3rd box, that’s like someone kind of stuck in a box, someone inside stuck in a box and I feel like there’s immediately a turn when you say you gotta think out the box. I feel like at work it’s like when you think out the box, just when I say, you’re stuck in a box and you gotta think out of it. This is the box, it’s like you’re thinking within this little, this little cocoon, you know. Then in, there is our (38:23 - distance space), it’s like you need to think out of that like to actually like prepare, like, do you know what I mean? Otherwise you can’t move in this box, you can’t do anything. Do you know what I mean? Like, you can’t do much. Sleep [laughing], like that’s it [laughing louder]. That’s it, that’s what you could do in this box. Like, yeah. Um tell me more who, like who, what would be that person. Tell me more about that person stuck in that box? Be someone, someone that’s trying to, someone that’s growing so they must have been smaller and they’ve grown and they’re growing out of the box and like the box is exploding and they’re free. So it kinda looks like a little story, my little journey cause it’s been like I’ve had all week where it’s like, last week it was one of the best weeks of my life, like literally the best week cause I realised a lot of stuff, it’s like I knew a lot, I knew a lot, I knew a lot but then every smart person is not probably as smart as they think until they realise stuff like for yourself as well you gotta realise like for yourself before others and that’s what I’ve realised, it’s like I kept going back in the loop thinking why is this like not working this way? I gotta think what am I doing that’s wrong? Do you know what I mean? You’re probably, I’m probably doing wrong things that I’m not really thinking, thinking about it that much, you’re just surrounded, you’re not thinking like that, cause you’re just around stuff, you’re just whatever. And that’s the box. When you say you’re surrounded by stuff and you don’t think of things, can you tell me more about that? Cause you’re kind of like asleep, you’re not, it’s like you’re around stuff but it’s like you’re not really, you’re not really aware of how it’s affecting you, do you know what I mean? It’s like you wanna grow but you can’t grow enough, that’s why the back is a bit hunched [the back referring to the person in the drawing for box 3], cause it’s still growing it’s a process, can you see the process, the growth like through the hunch. And when you say the surroundings, what are the surroundings? Can you tell you more about that? It’s four walls, so it’s like a prison. I feel like that’s the best way to show a visual. Visual, concept of like being being stuck cause it’s already it’s not, I’m not as base as like, this person is accustomed to and then you can see the growth happening, do you know what I mean? So you’re saying that basically, not being able to grow and being sort of stuck in situations, not feeling like you’re growing can make one feel lonely. Yeah but it it’s grown but it didn’t realise it’s grown until he felt, do you know what I mean he’s surrounded. You have to feel it and then snap on, you know? So now (he’s fallen on his head to the side-  41:42) that kind of symbolises the brain it’s like, you have to think here first cause you don’t, when you live in a high ceiling you can’t really like, do you know what I mean? You can’t really, nothing’s stopping you, you feel like you can jump, stuff like that, do you know what I mean? You’re still stuck in the box. Now the ceiling needs space now, it needs to break out like do you know what I mean? Tell me more about what’s holding that individual. Yourself. You can’t blame anyone for anything that happens around you, you cannot blame anyone, only yourself. In any situation you put yourself you could only blame yourself. Like, in times of like you walk where ever you walk to do you know what I mean? If I walk out of this house today and something happens that’s me cause I chose to go out today do you know what I mean? [laughing], it’s like that’s meaning in terms of like I can walk out right now I’ve been out before and I’ve met someone that’s impacted my life it’s like in a bad way. If I didn’t go out that day, I wouldn’t have met that person. Do you know what I mean? If I didn’t go out in a certain day in 2012 I wouldn’t have met you. Do you get it, it’s like I wouldn’t have met you, cause the only reason I met you is through someone I know that I met in 2012 [laughing], like do you know what I mean? So, you’re saying that basically that the only thing that’s holding that person is themselves, not letting that person grow, the person knows that, you knew that you were growing but then, but then they stopped growing. Yeah. Because? Just cause themselves. Tell me more about those. Just being in that box, it’s like… What does that box represent? It represents everything, it’s everything, everything that’s like happening, so everything that’s happened round you, do you know what I mean? Cause it’s nobody, everything is happening around you, it’s like if I’m in a box, like, I’ve taken everything in ready, like, do you know what I mean? You’re taking everything cause you’re in the box and it’s like when you step out of the box, it’s like you could literally do whatever, like, in terms of like and my life could be as great as I want it to be from my decisions not whatever I make. The decisions I make I can do whatever I want, like I just need to know, I need to allow myself to be out of that box and explore, that’s the one thing, do you know what I mean, people need to do, so like in box 4, the whole reason I got good at what I’m doing, exploring, like, do you know what I mean? It’s like reading people like, education, it’s like exploring different, different art forms, education is an art form, like, they’re all arts, it’s like, these are all arts, psychology is an art form or understanding the brain, do you know what I mean? It’s like there’s all different art forms, it’s like you just gotta explore, like, it’s like, I started reading like the theory of colour by Isaac Newton like last year or two years ago and it’s like I understand way more about the colour now than I ever did because I read the like, I understand what different colours have effect on the eyes and stuff like that and the eye colours that people see less at certain ages, I know that now, so I could like make films that is related to certain demographics through colour which is crazy. I didn’t know that until I read that. It’s like I understand why certain people love certain movies now, like marvel or DC I understand this like now, I get it, it’s like, it’s so easy and it’s like through education it made it way easier for me now, did what I did before ( 46:18), I would have been struggling for years like just cause I open my self to education, to certain amount of education, it’s like I know now, it’s like, so I love reading, I’m an avid reader, I’m even reading books right now, the age of the reckless woman. It’s like you just gotta keep allowing yourself to take in education, it’s crazy, it’s like, it helps so much, it helps so much, (no foods to eat and stuff like that 46:49). The reason why people are dying is like, we don’t know, like, people don’t really know their own bodies like you don’t know your own body, like, you don’t know the human body nor what you meant to eat. You’re not even meant to eat meat, like you’re not meant to eat that but people eat it cause it’s on TV, burglaries like, you know what I mean? Like, black people love like greasy food and stuff cause it’s on TV, that’s what we’re known for eating, do you know what I mean? But which is funny, go back to Africa, they don’t eat meat, it’s not a big part of like African diet, African person’s diet, do you know what I mean, it’s not a big, do you know what I mean? It’s not a big thing, I can tell you that for sure. They eat more fish than anything, like, they eat fish, vegetables, like fruits. People don’t meant to eat meat, it’s like, that’s like the worst in the civilisation, it’s not, like, do you know what I mean? People that live in rural parts of the world don’t eat meat a lot. They just have, they have, they see animals as especial creature more like, it’s like weighed out, this part of the world sees everything as consumption, like, trying to consume everything, the Western World, everyone just wants to consume, like, everything is for consumption, it’s like, what’s the next, what’s the next new food, like what’s, it’s like. Is there anything you want to say? No, that’s all. Okay, can we talk about the 4th box? The 4th box. Yes. That’s two, this is two bits, this is a process of being free, two sides of the boxes have been gone, like, it can move a certain way now, do you understand? It’s taken baby steps, you’re moving, moving vertical. So you can move now, like, like, likely now you could know how you can now move. Like, portrait, kind of landscape, do you know what I mean? You can be free, it’s like this bit this bit here is a last bit of the freedom [referring to box 4] which I think every human that, I feel like that’s the last bit of freedom as humans that we’re trying to find, that last thing cause it’s like you can’t go up ye, do you know what I mean? You can only move this way and that way [referring to going sideways/horizontally], like, do you know what I mean? You can only jump only as high as like, I don’t know, a couple of feet, like, like, like two feet isn’t it? [laughing]. That’s, I feel like that’s one, the last stage of like kind of like being a lion cause you can move up now, no one can do that yet, do you know what I mean? It’s like everyone’s moving this way, you can only walk backwards forwards, you can’t move up or down, like do you know what I mean? That’s the last bit, do you know what I mean? That’s the last bit of being free cause he’s free now (not as that free – 50:13). So you’re saying that, that person is free now after having come from the box that he was in before that, okay. Tell me more about, tell more about, how does that impact loneliness, you think? Cause it’s like, you can’t be lonely anymore. Cause it’s like you’re allowing yourself to move now do you know what I mean? You can move vertically now, you can move now, so it’s like you could that, you can meet where ever, you can do whatever, it’s like nothing really matters and then his head’s kind of fuzzy here cause he’s new to it, he’s kind of showing like a new feeling, it’s like, when you’re kind of happy, this whole above your head that feels fuzzy like do you know what I mean? And then, a really simple drawing but it’s like [laughing]. So that person is now free, that person can move, can explore, and now they don’t feel lonely, in a way, you’re saying. Yeah. OK. How does that make you feel or how would that make that person feel? It makes you feel like you’re new, you’re starting again, kind of thing, a reborn kind of thing. Like start again, from scratch. OK, thank you. Is there anything else you want to say? No, that’s all. OK. I’m going to pause the interview now. Interview 11, part 2 Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Interviewee Interviewer Okay, so can we talk about what you've put in the first box, please? Maryland's studio work, like Maryland is the area I used to live in before, I met a lot of good people in that area, that's a good part of my life. A lot of the people that I've met there, they really influenced me to do what I am doing today, like being around that type of people, like, love it, love, so I loved that area. Um... so basically being around people that kind of push you, motivate you, makes you feel socially connected? Yeah, definitely. Okay, tell me more about that. It's like, you know, when you're around people that accept you for who you are, even though they grew up in a rough neighbourhood, but they understand, understand what you're trying to do, so it's like they're pushing you to keep doing what you're doing because you know, there's a big, it's a big part of, there's a bigger purpose than me, myself, do you know what I mean? It's gonna help a lot of other people think a certain way, do you know what I mean? And then, I feel, that's really, that's really a good place to be because pe-, people like that understand, understand how the world works in a small form, do you know what I mean? It's like, that's how I see it, yeah. Um... so when you're around people who understand you, who get you, who know you quite well, who know the struggles, the good things and stuff, you feel most socially connected around them. Yeah. How does that make you feel? It makes me feel, it makes me comfortable, you know, it makes me feel comfortable, because you know, know the same thing, they know what I'm trying to do as well, you kind of understand what I'm trying to do, so it's like, it's easier to be around people like that, yeah. Nice, um... did you put studio, also? Yeah. Can you tell me more about that? Yeah, I love creating, so I just, I'm a creative, I just want to create all the time, like all the time, if I could just, like, just get paid to just make stuff like that, that's just, that's what I want to do, like just make things, like create ideas, like, do you know what I mean? Just like, I just want to do that, that's what I want to do and it's like, yeah, that's where I feel comfortable, being in a studio, creating. ... makes you feel connected to other people? Yeah, yeah, I feel like this is how I connect to people, do you know what I mean? So, expressing yourself, kind of doing the things that you like, you know, being able to be your true self and being able to be creative, makes you feel connected to other people. Yeah. Makes you feel socially connected. Yeah. Tell me about that. It's like, it's kind of like making, making stuff makes me feel like this is my role in this world, and it's like, do you know what I mean? I just feel like, you feel like this is what I am meant to be doing and that's what makes me feel comfortable, like knowing that I'm doing this and I feel good about it, so I want to do more of it, yeah, so I want to do more and the better I am as a person as well, the better the work we get as well, because it works hand in hand, yeah. How do you feel about that? I feel, I feel great *laughs*, yeah. Okay, do you want to say anything, anything else? No, that's all. Okay, can we talk about what you've put in box two, please? Clubs, so I feel like places where... it's a certain way, people act in certain ways and you have to act a certain a way, I don't like being in places like that, what if you're not doing something or you're not acting a certain way, people feel, see you as if you were a weirdo or something like that, like, it's like you don't even know someone, you don't even know someone, so you can't really judge them after seeing them in that place, so I don't like that, so people see you and they feel like you are a certain type of person, just because you act in some way. That's why I don't really like being in clubs, it's like, it's not for me, but I go there because it's like, I know that's a good place for me to network, do you know what I mean? In my industry, anyway, I met a lot of people like that, so I would, I know, like, it's, it's good to network like that, I usually go just to network and that's it really, I don't like the whole culture, like, it's like bullshit, but I have to be there, if I didn't, like, I want to be in a place where I don't need to be at these places, like, unless I'm getting paid *laughs*, do you know what I mean? Like, I don't need to look for girls and stuff like that, I don't need to do that, like I know girls, I can speak to a woman on the street, like don't need to like go to a club and get someone drunk, like, like *laughs*, do you know what I mean? It's like, you don't need to do that, that's just yeah, and I decided I don't really like it, it's like very pretentious like, it's very like... yeah, it's just not for me. You mentioned pretentious; can you tell me more about that?  It's like everyone, it's like, kind of like everyone, when everyone has like kind of an agenda as well, like, so everyone has an agenda, like when you go to a club, everyone has an agenda, you're not just there for no reason, it's a club, do you know what I mean? That's another thing, do you know what I mean? As well. When you say that people have an agenda... Yeah, it's like, they're trying to do something, do you know what I mean? Everyone has an agenda, just like I said I'm going to network, other people have different agendas, as well, it's like, one type of people are there *says while yawning* to like get girls, like, do you know what I mean? And stuff like that, and it's like 'cool'. How does that make you feel?   No ways like, do what you want to do and it's cool, but it's like, for me it's like, I don't feel like I should be there, the type of life that I want to live like... I couldn't be caught somewhere like that, you don't catch like, do you know what I mean? Like someone who is like, I don't know, for instance, how can I say? Like you wouldn't catch someone like Kendrick Lamar like or someone like at certain places, do you know what I mean? Because he's doing certain things, it's like, you couldn't even, do you know what I mean? It's like, I feel like, me, putting myself in those places it's like I'm, it's another way of like blocking myself and stuff, but at the same time, so it's weird, so I am wasting time, I should be doing stuff like, all of these things, I should be doing these things, like that's it, I should be doing... *gets interrupted* ... working in the studio? Yeah, just for now like, do you know what I mean? I should be doing these things, that's what, do you know what I mean? I should be doing right now, I want to do it, but it's like, it's not, not being able to do it, do you know what I mean? Just like, yeah. Okay, is there anything else you want to say?  No.  Okay, thank you, we can now move on... *recording stops*"
